"I have been in a relationship for the past few months and for the first 3 of the months things have been good. This month as been very stressful between work and school and my mental health have just been deteriorating, and because of that I’ve been more easily irritated. I get into arguments now with my gf everyday about the most mundane things. I am mostly at fault since I’m the one starting them, I’ve just felt like nothing has been enough or certain things she doe’s irritates me. I don’t blame her for anything, she has been the best partner ever and has been very supportive. I just can’t get a hold of my temper and I’m scared it’s gonna drive us apart.

"Hello I'm currently in my third year of university. Since the start I have been very stressed and at times had bad thoughts come into my head. I tried to talk to my parents about switching programs or go to university with less expectations (The University I'm going to is known to be brutal to their students). Sadly that didn't work which I understand from my parents side if I get through it then it will pay off. The next two years for me is just going to be quite scary as I'll be doing a Full Time course load in the Fall, Spring and Summer for two years straight. Just ranting I guess and some sort of motivation would be nice honestly.

School for me has always been a stressful topic and has never changed even in high school I'd say I've always been so anxious or stressed about the topic. Though what I can say is that once I do the two years at least I am out and finish my degree and I can move on from the idea of school. Just ranting at this point as this topic has definitely affected me a lot through out the years but this week it has affected me more than ever but I am now coming into terms that with the two year plan I got going it's not going to be that bad forever.",University Degree Stress,0
"I really wish anyone can help me or i just wanna know if anyone is experiencing the same things i am because i havent found anyone who has. Im getting headaches/migraines every single day. Its been around 2 months now, this isnt the first time this has happened to me it happened 2 years ago same thing. I had migraines every single day non stop for like a year straight, to the point where i couldnt even eat and developed photophobia and couldtn even turn on my room lights or anything. So it eventually went away after a couple months but im back in here again. Doctors tell me that its stress/anxiety but it just doesnt make sense to me as to why it gets this bad to the point where i cant even get up from my bed or be awake for long hours before feeling pain, no one gets it this bad for this long, 7+ months NON Stop??? So it started around November with panic attacks and anxiety, usually something triggers my anxiety and i can control it, but no not this time it happens even when im happy out of nowhere i just feel bad all the time and super weak, then it progressed to me feeling okay in the morning and bad at night, i always knew id feel bad at night so i would do my daily duties during the day. Then it progressed even more to where i started getting my migraines/headaches every day and the light started triggering them. And now end of march im back in my room again lights off, headaches everyday, cant go out cant do anything, i can barely even be on my phone, lights all the way down and blue light off. I did notice though that it starts in my neck and shoulders and where my arms start on my back. I massage myself everyday, i try to take medications but they all give me extreme side effects even tylenol. I know itll be a few months before i get better, but i wish i knew more people that have gone thru this, i even tried magnesium gummies and got side effects from those as well. Ive been doing so well with my anxiety and i try to feel okay and get distracted but the pain never ever ever goes away just gets worse and calms down, please someone help!",Chronic stress help,0
"I thought I had it under control, then I had a surgery and was put into surgical menopause, then well. Title says the rest.

I'm on short term disability leave, I got put on another team in a lower role for when I return to work, but i can't let this happen again.

My triggers Ive found are repeating myself, getting ignored completely, ""have time for a quick call?"", and having to do other people's jobs for them. Now this all being said, none of that should have been happening anyway because all that is supposed to go to my TOM, not me.

"I am in my mid 30s and have just been given the chance to do an extra year and a half of study in a different University. The degree that I have was more theory based and I really need hands on experience to be employable in my field, which I now have the opportunity to do alongside guaranteed internships and portfolio work. 

My stress levels are currently through the roof about this, as I am worried that I won't be able to match the calibre of current high school leavers, who, even though treated as adults at University, still seem to have that high school mentality. My main issue is, even though not permanent, the dorm style accommodation and the fact that an ""old"" person is living with basically a teenager, although I did apply for a single room with a shared bathroom, so maybe not so bad. 

Usually I wouldn't have a problem with this, but already having experienced this with not much success, I am now stressing immensely. I'm not there to be anybody's friend, but the way I have been treated in the past, just for being a little older has been disgusting. There is not much available accommodation at all in the country, so looking for anything else is currently out.

"I wonder.. is it my stress, time management, or myself as a person in general that is blocking myself from doing the best I can? Or is it my anxiety and overthinking getting to me?

I am a F14 in my freshman year of high school, currently going through a roller coaster of thoughts and emotions. I'm trying really hard managing between piano, soccer, and my grades with school. I love everything equally, (well maybe except school..), but in the end, my grades are my priority over piano or soccer. I know that piano and soccer may benefit me throughout high school, but grades are more important. But that doesn't mean I'm going to give up on neither one. 

But here I am with a B- (84.5) in my history class, and I need to get it to an A- (90.1) by the end of my school final which is in about 2 months. Well I'll need an A- at least, so I could take AP Euro in my sophomore year, and it's only available in my sophomore year as well. AP Euro is definitely not a necessity for my next year in high school, but it'll benefit me a lot, and as my school is very tough and competitive, I want to achieve my goal and do it. My teacher is crazy strict, being 87 years old, he has his more ""older-fashioned"" and more ""understandable"" ways of grading. So I stress trying to fit into his perfect standards, but at the end of the day, I keep telling myself. In the future, there will always be people that will be wanting a perfect requirement that fits them. I will need to be able to be adjusting to those specific requirements, for the future, to benefit myself and my ideal career future and more.

I've never gotten a B, or a grade range in the B section (B-, B, or B+) throughout middle school and my first semester of high school until now. Is it the stress that's piling on me after all these hard schoolwork I'm not managing well or enough with my time that I have? My sleep schedule is actually horrid, I usually sleep at 2-4AM waking up at 6AM, with soccer practice 3-4 times a week (usually I skip at least 1 day a week since it's a little too much), and 2 lessons of piano a week. Also including the clubs I've decided to join, Mock Trials, which is now coming to an end with competitions. Volunteering, which I guess I could choose which days to help out.. but.. The homework. The load at my school is actually crazy, about 2-3 assignments new each period, which is every day, so in a week total about 30-40 assignments, which is quite a buttload. It's due either the following days, or sometimes, a miracle as it is it'll be due next week. But then again, there's at least 1-2 tests a week, which I need to study a lot for. Oh of course, there's also the projects and essays, let's add about 1 for every other week. 

Should I take a break from piano or soccer, and put my grades at my priority instead? I think I can be able to take my grade, 84.5% up to a 90.1% at least, which is \~6% of a percentage raise that I'll need to be okay. Telling my friends this, all I get in response is the same, ""It'll be okay."" All I wish these days is someone to tell me more than ""it'll be okay"". I'm still new to the environment of high school, and figuring out what fits for me, and what doesn't fit for me. Encouragement, something I haven't heard in awhile, is what I hope boosts me. Thanks for reading this far.

TLDR ; Not having the most decent grade in history class (84.5%), wanting to take AP Euro next year for my class, I need at least a 90.1% for my requirement to join the class. Struggling with the management of piano and soccer as well for my extracurricular activities, as well as school clubs, should I take a break from something? I need to put my grades before other stuff, including the fact to not freak out with studying and use time well. Also wish someone could tell me, I'm able to do it, and they have confidence in me. Thanks again.",Am I choosing the right mindeset?,0

I just finished my second term today. I got my marks — great, btw.

"I'm 28. Had 6 dates in my life. Never had sex before. Had 1 bad acquaintance that I needed therapy to deal with.

I don't hate women. I don't think everything is pointless. I chat with coworkers, but I don't have a lot of friends. Ladies seem to think I'm a nice person and funny. I don't have much trouble shamelessly asking someone out. I've long thought I have enough hobbies and interests and goals to keep myself mentally stable and preoccupied. Doesn't stop everyone from saying I'm a sweet guy who just needs to be more confident, less sensitive, and wait for the right person.

I get flustered when I meet someone flirty or shameless, but I play it off with self-deprecation and wit.

I had a date with a coworker who was coming onto me frequently  (poking me, prodding me, talking about bodily functions, giving me looks and signs and thank yous, took my phone number, called me, wishes me morning, acts like she's out of breath around me, talks about and asks me sexual questions, talks about her dating history, etc).

She wanted to go to a Barne's and Noble's. I was 10 minutes late due to traffic and she'd shown up an hour early to give herself a headstart.

She stood next to me, I comically volunteered to be pack mule, and we sat and read books for a while, talking in-between. She made a spa appointment at 4pm. I asked her what she wanted - 1) friendship, 2) casual sex, 3) a relationship. I wasn't good for 2 (no confidence).

She described to me frequently about how much her previous relationships messed her up, we talked indirectly our thoughts about romance and such.

Her answer was 1 and she said she didn't know what the future hold.

We left and I went to a Chic-filet she'd informed me was there. Then I drove home rather than wait the hour for her appointment to finish, said I had fun, and drove home listening to Drowning Pool and Foo Fighters.

I got home, played a video game, laid down, and fought back tears feeling every insecure and negative thought I've had about myself. This date was something I wanted and it felt like I came away with less than I started with. She said she'd text me later and didn't get around to it until much later, and even though it was a short time I felt myself getting lonelier and madder because we just weren't having the initial flirty back and forth we did before the date.

I turned my phone off.

Everyone is going to tell me ""there's a million fish"" and she even said ""some people just don't vibe"" but the messages are just so unclear to me right now. This isn't too long after I broke up with someone who I felt like I did vibe with.

I just can't see myself continuing to give this much energy toward meeting someone new another 5-00 times like everybody else. I'm a sensitive person. I feel drained and hateful of everyone that dating comes so easily to even though I know that's wrong. I'm so mad we didn't click its embarassing, and I know it's not her fault. I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't feel like exercising or doing anything positive. I just want to be angry.

I guess I walked in expecting she'd throw herself at me, and I'd have the chance to be a gentleman and be like ""hey I like you, but I want to get to know you"" and she'd be like ""ah he's not just a desperate fuck, he has character."" And well that didn't happen. Instead I feel like I got read and told politely I wasn't what someone was looking for. And any attempt at friendship on my end will be a desperate act.

I could be entirely wrong. 

I would have liked if we'd hugged at the end or made additional plans. She agreed to doing something in the near future but I didn't get any excitement out of it. Optimistically I want to say we could probably be friends. Cynically I think she's not going to reach out and I spent an hour each way driving, took a day off of work for what I wanted to be a great date - I did all of that for nothing.

Of the 3 actual dates I've gone on after many years of rejection and indifference - the first didn't know how to tell me she wasn't interested and ghosted me for weeks, the second said sweet things about me but said she wasn't ready and was still healing from a previous relationship and said I need to be with someone who can do 50-50 in the relationship, and now this, where I felt someone coming onto me and tried to match it, and realizing at the end that I walked away in a toxic cloud of mental fog.

I hate dating. So much. And I hate the way my brain and my emotions work. So much.",I'm mad and sulking over a single bad date.,0
"so for context ive had an abusive dad growing up, and everyday living with him changed me. i feared getting yelled at for doing kid things, getting suffocated because i was crying. thinking about that now makes me mad of what i have to go through, but now i put that behind me. recently i’ve been stressed because of my bf and that internal problem just led up to more things, such as my purpose in life, who i want to be, and just self doubt. i feel like i’m not surrounding myself with the right people because i think they’re taking advantage of me, and are extremely careless to me. besides people, i’ve been feeling numb to the world. i feel like a robot and other peoples true self are showing a lot more. it feels like i’m high except.. i’m not high. the smaller things in my head stands out more like the noise outside my window. i’m usually not concentrated on that, but my brain picks it up more easily like i’m more aware of these things happening. my surroundings feels a lot different from usual. but i know myself when i’m completely normal versus when i’m out of it. there’s some people from reddit that told me i had an experience of depersonalization. i smoked before to get rid of some stress, and smoking mildly i know will not make me feel this way. the stress is overwhelming me and i feel trapped. but right now i had a vivid nightmare and it’s about the people in my real life. it affects me more and it’s the first time i’ve experience an actual nightmare. i usually don’t remember my dreams and i move past it, but this time it gave me a lot of stress, i remember the whole plot and context, the whole energy of it, and it’s scaring me.

-no appetite (i’ve been eating a small meal once a day now.. it’s barely anything) 
-insomnia (which 2 weeks ago, everything was normal) 
-paranoia 
-a bunch of thoughts on my mind (usually negative) 
-no meaning in life and sadness. like an empty or sort of numb feeling 
-realization that’s talking or texting feels a lot different, it wasn’t the same normal feeling from before, it felt
like i changed in way that isn’t permanent.. i hope) 
-nightmare (which kind of made me realize that there’s something i’m going through that isn’t normal at all, i’ve been through some shit but i’ve never had an actualt nightmare with a plot and this intense before, it lasted about an hour until i woke up)

"I've been planning my wedding that is happening in May of this year.

I got engaged a few months ago in January, and at first I felt fine with taking on everything but now it's starting to get into my head and I feel overwhelmed everyday.

My days consist of me working, wedding planning, and sleeping. Most of the time if i'm doing something other than that, I'm thinking of my wedding anyways. If I go shopping there's always something that will catch my eye and remind me of what I need to do or purchase for the big day.

Not only that, but my partner is in another country (LDR) and he can only do so much to help me with it all besides pay for things here and there. I live on my own while my partner lives at home (he's never been on his own before) and i'm struggling to pay for small things like a DJ or even cake.

I've tried talking to him about wedding stuff and he tends to get overwhelmed or be distracted with other things he's doing like gaming etc. Last night, I was talking to him about décor options we had and I showed him our ceremony space. It's on a terrace/large outdoor patio at this nice hotel in my city. I went personally to view the venue a week after we got engaged, sent him videos and photos, and he loved it too! Now when i showed him the photos last night he made a few ""not so happy"" faces and I almost started crying right there from the stress of it all. He kept saying ""I guess it'll have to do.."" and things like that. Felt like I screwed it up so bad.

I feel like a failure, that I picked a bad venue...and to top it all off I have a few people in my bridal party who are being really catty towards me now. They keep shitting on me for having ""bad communication"" even though I'm trying my best and have everything on MY shoulders. They haven't offered to do anything specific but constantly say ""I want to help in any way I can! Let me know what to do!"" and I have no clue what to ask them. Also, a bridesmaid of mine really dislikes my MOH and tries to make me feel like she's not doing ""enough"" and says she feels she's unsupportive.

I didn't even want a big wedding at a hotel. I originally imagined a wedding where I am married at a nice park, have dinner at a nice restaurant and then go to a pub for a beer after to celebrate.

The only reason it became a big wedding is because of my in laws and my family coming, plus a bunch of my friends wanted to go. My fiancé is only bringing 3 family members and none of HIS friends are going to come (despite travelling to Mexico for a wedding recently).

After all this, I can see why people elope or have really really small weddings.",Feel like everything thinks i'm annoying and I'm unhappy with how I never stand up for myself.,0

"Hi,

I’m a sales director who recently received a promotion to build and lead a new sales operation for an Australian media company in a foreign country. After relocating my family and settling into our new home, I found the job to be manageable, albeit stressful, for the first 8-9 months.

However, after a year, I've realized that the stress has become a part of my daily routine, and it's starting to change my personality. I'm experiencing burnout, feeling completely drained, unmotivated, and even depressed at times.

I'm struggling to decide if I should push through this or throw in the towel. On one hand, the benefits of international experience, such as building and managing a team in a new market and exploring new commercial initiatives, are invaluable. On the other hand, the stress is taking its toll, and I'm not sure if it's worth it.

"Hi Reddit, I'm here to vent about my stress, and honestly, I have no one to talk to. I am F (23), and last year I started my first ""big girl job"" as a copywriter in marketing. I originally studied filmmaking to be a screenwriter or producer, anything to get me to be on set. My love and passion for being behind the scenes and seeing the projects come to life are breathtaking. I enjoy talking to the cast, getting behind the camera, and being transported to a different unique world. So why was my first big job in marketing? 

During the pandemic, my concern was how to get myself out there when I was very limited in making connections and unable to go out and shoot because of social distancing measures due to the pandemic. The school I was in offered an internship for a class in marketing, and I took it (honestly, anything to make my portfolio and resume look good). Not going to lie; the internship was fun and exciting, so when they offered me an entry-level position in marketing, I was hesitant. I didn't study marketing or advertising or anything related to that, just filmmaking. They knew that I only had knowledge of film but still wanted to give me a chance to explore my career options. Now, having been here for a year, I've built up an extreme amount of stress.

Every single day I am constantly feeling stressed, anxious, and depressed. I'm always messing up, and it has gotten to the point where I received a PIP. I saw it coming. 

I am struggling with my grammar, not being strong enough when it comes to presenting, and lacking creativity. Things are so rushed here that I often miss a thing or two, which reflects poorly on me. Being dyslexic doesn't help either. As a result, I received a PIP, and it has spiked my stress levels and anxiety to the point where I feel sick every day. I can't eat, don't feel like getting out of bed, can't breathe, can't sleep, and can't think clearly.

Additionally, I have been struggling with a yeast infection for six months (yes, you read that right). My doctor says I have a candida overgrowth, so I am on a strict diet in hopes of getting it under control.

The whole experience is making me feel like a failure, like I've made a big joke out of myself. My manager talked to me and said that copywriting marketing isn't for me because I didn't learn it, and he knows my skills lie elsewhere. I agree, but I am afraid I won't find a job in film with how the economy is and the difficult hiring process I see on social media. It's terrifying. How am I going to pay for school, debt, help my parents, pay for groceries for this stupid candida diet, and help my grandma in Mexico, and more bills?

My parents and a coworker of mine are giving me words of encouragement and saying that everything is going to be okay. They say I should still be proud because I tried something new, created a new set of skills, and toughened up. I don't know if that's true.",I can't stop thinking and I need to vent!!,0
"Sorry if this isn't appropriate for here, but the stress is killing me. I'm 24 and I feel like I've got the stress of a 45 year old going through a midlife crisis! 

Three weeks ago, I started up a new job with security, I got one 6 hour shift, and three 12 hour shifts. Honestly, I love this job despite the hours, and I can handle it. 

But, this past week? Everything feels like it fell apart. My sister popped over with her husband on a surprise visit ( haven't seen her in 14 years ) so it should've been exciting, but all it did was bring trouble to our already fragile household. She instigated drama with my father and everyone else, then her boyfriend was just causing problems with zero consequences. Then, two days later, my Uncle shows up and it's all great.. up until he hits me with news tonight that he's got cancer and he's trying to enjoy himself since he's scared of worse case scenario. All of this on top of family dilemmas with my father, seeing it affect my grandmother? ALL tied together with the very awkward sleep I get, I can just feel my mental health regressing back to incredibly old, toxic, unhealthy ways. I wanna smoke weed to ignore the stress and call off work, but I know doing all that will ruin any progress I've ever made. 

Oh, I'm also having allergies worse than ever so my nose is constantly dried up, in pain, slightly bleeding and my eyes itch like hell. I know I'm just yapping at this point, but good lord, it feels like way too much to stomach in such a short amount of time.

"One of the best ways to decrease how much total stress you experience is by adding good forms of stress (short and moderate) called hormetic stressors.  Cold water is a prototypical hormetic stressor.  It releases stress hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline but it is short and not extreme.   

We just launched an app that provides guided cold showers to make it easy for you to do them.  It is led by a Master Chief Navy SEAL.  We teach you a set of mental tools around tactical breathwort, body relaxation, self talk, etc.  These tools not only make cold showers easier but they also help you handle stress more generally.    

In fact, the best way to train yourself to handle stress better is to systematically stress yourself and then practice these tools while stressed.  If you do that, these tools will become reflexive any time your body generates stress hormones.

When I try to think of a reason why I'm feeling like that, I do not have a single clue. My life is good and I have everything I need/want but I keep looking for small things that make me feel unhappy and anxious. I can stay awake and panic/overthink over all kinds of small things like this. I just want to feel happy and stop overthinking constantly but I do not know how to do that. Sometimes I think it will get better when I'll get older (25y right now). But the negative feelings are taking over more frequently and  I am ready to start working on it  so I can actually enjoy life. Any advice?",Does anyone feel the same?,0

"I work at an engineering firm that surveys underground utilities and drain systems. I started work last July and it has been a never ending stream of all consuming stress and anxiety for me. It feels like I can’t escape from work and it never ends, and it feels like no matter how hard I try my work always gets thrown back at me with my boss telling me it’s horribly wrong and that I had no idea what I was doing. It’s not like I don’t ask him for help either, he will review my work and offer revisions, only to go back and find new instances that he didn’t mention before. 
If all I had to do was draft I’d be okay with that. But because the company is so small everyone does every project on their own start to finish, from proposal to cost estimate to survey to drafting to finish. All I know how to do is draft, and because everyone has been so busy I haven’t been able to learn the other skills. 
I’ve also been given another near impossible task that I have been trying to teach myself how to do, but I also haven’t even had time in my work day to do that. 
Even my coworkers are all older than me by a significant margin, and have been in this business for quite some time. They live to work, and I don’t have anything in common in which forms camaraderie. 
Literally the only thing keeping me here is the pay. Which is very good, but I cant live like this. I feel exhausted and broken when I get home. I feel like I can’t do anything after.

"Whatever you’re trying to achieve - save the world, write a novel, devote yourself to a particular cause – there are likely to be those who will be critical. Some people just have a critical disposition while others will take issue with the specifics of your particular endeavour. Criticism is unavoidable. Your choice is in how to respond to it. 

### Consider these strategies for managing the critics in your life:

**Clarify your purpose.** As humans, we are compelled to make meaning. Making meaning for ourselves – and value for others – is fundamental to a life well lived. When you’re doing something very important to you, you care far less about the criticisms of others. If they can easily throw you off your path, you might want to reflect on how important it really is to you. Are you living your purpose consistent with you values?

**Understand the critic’s motivation.** Are they projecting themselves in to the situation – their aspirations, their skill set, their propensity for risk, their values? Are they genuinely trying to protect you from any potential down-sides? Are they trying to maintain the status quo – for you, them or both? Are they masking their own lack of action? 

**Recognise that criticism is not balanced appraisal.** We have evolved to notice negative issues more readily than positive ones. We are more likely to notice criticism than encouragement: people working against us over people supporting us. Most people are actually indifferent to you and your life so get on and live it.

**Realize that you’re going to be criticized no matter what you do.** Whether you become a billionaire, movie star, teacher, doctor, or sit on the couch all day, there is someone that will tell you that you’re doing the wrong thing. So, live your life building towards what you do want rather than what the critics don’t want.

**Respond calmly.** Rather than giving your critics the pleasure of an emotional response, respond kindly with a considered response. Acknowledge any leaps of faith you are making. 

**Use your critics as motivation.** While some people are intimidated and deflated by the critics of the world, others are able to use the negative comments as a source of motivation. Remind yourself that while the critics are standing on the sidelines, you are on the pitch and playing the game.

**Decide if they have something useful to say.** Some criticism may carry valid points – explore these with your critic and ask what their solution would be – the response differentiates between useful and harmful dialogue. If the criticism isn’t useful, move on. You have more important things to do.

**Take criticism as a compliment.** Most people will leave you alone if you’re struggling or aren’t doing anything noteworthy. You only become a significant target of negative comments if you’re doing well. If you’re taking a lot of heat, you must be doing something correct!

**Live your life without the need for the approval of others.** Live your own life, by your own values. Use your signature strengths to create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future in your chosen pursuit.

"Society expects us to have kids, house, nice car and a “successful” career to be “happy”.

We’re brainwashed into following this “dream” right from school and put ourselves through great deal of stress pain and suffering.

Unless you’re born into wealth you have to give your life away and work for someone else’s dream with the tales that one day you will have the same amount of wealth and along the way you’re reminded how far away you are and compare yourself to others that have just that bit more than you.

You sacrifice your life, freedom, health, relationship all for some pocket change and a supposed wealth while others are milking from your sacrifice this making you feel like a failure, feeling like that dream is further and further away.

It’s a mindset you need to teach yourself, a mindset where your head is clear and at every obstacle you need to tell yourself no matter what it is that you’ll be fine because LIFE IS TOO SHORT AND CAN CHANGE IN AN INSTANT and then when your health suffers all of these aspirations and dreams do not matter.

I’ve been incidentally diagnosed with cancer - was very lucky as they’ve cut it out fairly quickly, only 3 nights in hospital, painless procedure. I’ve won a lucky dip with life because it was nothing, but seeing people who care about me being so upset was a horrible experience.

I wanted them to be happy and stop worrying because I’ve never thought much of myself then why would they? Because I am nothing, I am not worth anything, low self esteem, never had any aspirations, goals, only liked cars, wasn’t very social, couldn’t really talk to people and sat in my own head alot.

Showing how much those close to me cared for me made me change. When I lay in hospital my head was clear, didn’t worry about work, buying a house, savings or career. Only my family mattered and that’s how I’ve learned this mindset and began adapting my life around it, got rid of as much finance as I could, paid off my phone, sold the BMW bought a cheap Fiat for cash. Financial freedom helped with not worrying about money. Began saving money for a deposit for my new house in the future.

I keep reminding myself to enjoy the little things in life, going for a walk, going to a gym or even buying something fancy to eat here and there on my weekly shop, going restaurant and getting a carbonara or a new phone case. I’ve started eating healthy and looking after my health. I feel happy, proud of myself and I live week by week.

Of course I am aware I am very lucky and not everyone has the same opportunities in life and do not wish to upset anyone by this post. I hope this helps someone to find their path in life.",I hope this makes you feel better,0

Study Title: Evaluation of a Persuasive Mobile Application for Prompting Time Management Behaviour  If you are a student (part-time or full-time) enrolled in a degree program in a higher education institution, 18 years or older, and able to access a smartphone device, you are invited to evaluate the effectiveness of a persuasive app. The app aims to persuade students to be more organized towards their tasks and study spaces.  

First, you will be asked to give consent to do the study and respond to pre-survey questions (take 20-25 mins), which consist of demographics questions, questions of your preference for organization toward your tasks and study space, level of perceived ability to control your time, and stress level. After answering the pre-survey questions and providing your email address, you will see a link to the app. By clicking the link, you will be able to download the app on your device.  

Second, you will use the app daily by adding your daily tasks and organizing them based on their importance/urgency, marking them as complete, and engaging in social community features over four weeks. The app will send you notifications to emphasize the benefits of adhering to organizational acts and encourage you to minimize physical clutter in order to create a better-organized study space.  

At the end of the study, you will be asked to respond to the post-survey questions (take 20-25 mins), which is the same pre-survey question, including your experiences and perceived persuasiveness towards the app. The interview will be optional. There will be a question that asks you if you want to be interviewed, and by choosing “yes,” the researcher will communicate with you for an online interview which takes 15 mins. The interview will be audio recorded.  

Your participation is highly appreciated and is completely voluntary. All data will be treated confidential and for research purposes only. You will not be asked for any personal information other than your email to connect the pre survey, post survey, and the app usage.

"Hey Reddit,

This is my first post so bare with me - but I'm lost and I can no longer see the light in life. I've been working a crap job for the past two and a half years where I've been overworked. On top of that, my team is beyond toxic and our VP has caused so many issues to the point half of the team left, and the ones who remain are hanging on a thread to the point some are going on stress leave.

I feel stuck. I'm dealing with issues personally, at home, and at work. 

I keep applying to jobs but nothing comes out of it. I've done so many interviews and made it through to the final round only to be told I was a strong candidate but they went ahead with someone else.

I feel lost and hopeless. I battled so much in my life and got through severe depression in my teens to early twenties and what kept pushing me then was the fact that I thought I'd create something out of myself. I thought my future would be better. But it's not. 

The days are getting harder and I'm not sure what to do or where to go or who to turn to. I feel heavy all the time. I'm a 28 year old loser who has a stagnant career and a toxic job, no relationships, nothing. I'm losing hope",I can't see the light anymore.,0

"I’ll try to cut my story short in hope of someone out there being able to help me and guide me as I feel like I can no longer continue living with this feeling.

A general idea about myself is that I am a 22 yrs old medical student. I usually stress and worry a lot about medical school and my examinations, regardless of the fact that I score the highest amongst my batch. 

My story starts the summer of 2021 where I met a girl that goes to the same medical school as I do. Half way through the relationship problems start to arise between the two of us and I didn’t think anything of them as all relationships have their ups and downs. At this time, my partner began to say bad and mean things to me when we fought which initially didn’t affect me as I knew it was because of her being angry (she also reassured me after the fight resolves that she didn’t mean it). This started to escalate in which the problems became more frequent and almost every time I’ve had hurtful things being said to me. This progressively increased till the summer of 2022 (~11 months past for our relationship) which was the same summer in which I would take my Step 1 exam (a really important, exhausting and dreadful exam). At this point I used to always worry about our future and if were are even compatible, I used to have a weird heart clenching feeling that is filled with worry and anxiety, I also used to wake up from sleep several times with my heart racing or wake up before my alarm with the thought of our relationship overwhelming. We had a fight around 3 weeks before my exam which was my last straw and I communicated to my partner at that time that I want to end things as I felt I should communicate to her my true feelings that I no longer feel like I can continue in this relationship or think we have a future together (the things that were said to me where the worse out of all fights). She was devastated, cried and begged for me to give her another chance as she will change herself. I was heistant but decided to give her a chance, it worked out for the first few days but then the same heart clenching weird anxious feeling returned. I tried to battle it and not disclose it to her, but eventually I couldn’t hide it anymore and told her I couldn’t accept and give her another chance (around ~4 days before my exam). The whole 4 days and holiday after the exam was devastating I was really sad and down. With time, I used to distract myself and go out with friends (I don’t drink) almost every other day which helped me try to forget the whole situation. 

Keep in mind that I’ve got several messages from my ex weeks after the breakup about how I was wrong and that she would never forgive me and other prayers. Similarly over the last couple of months (it’s been 6 months since our breakup) I’ve been getting tiktok reposts from her account of videos taking about injustice and how sad/devastated she was which always made me feel very guilty as I was the reason for her current feelings. Similarly, it made me self-conscious about my decisions and doubt my feelings as she claims I never loved her and if I did I would never leave her.

Fast forward to the last month (5 months since breakup) where I finally approached a girl in my class that was always getting my attention and I couldn’t lay my eyes off her. In the first 3 days (through text), I was very happy and excited to get to know her. Three days later (which was also when the new school year started and the week of my important sport tournament) I started to have this same tiring, coruscating and exhaustive heart clenching feeling as if there is something I am worrying about. It started to increase progressively and I’ve always tried to forget it and keep it in the back of my head,, but it has been really taking a toll on me as I almost wake up everyday with this feeling and it stays throughout the day. Keeping in mind that throughout this period we’ve grown really close and she seems to really care about me. I have this feeling in the background around 60% of the day, 20% is me being distracted by work and friends and the remainder 20% consist of me actually overthinking and worrying. I really don’t understand why is this happening:
	a. Am I feeling guilty that I am meeting a new person?
	b. Am I worrying that this new relationship may end like the previous one?
	c. Am I scarred and no longer can commit to a relationship? 
	d. Why is the same feeling (but less intensity) that I was having before I left my ex happening again????
	e. Is the person not compatible for me and I am still seeking my ex?
	f. Did I still not move on from my previous relationship (prior to the new girl I was certain that I did move on and had 0 feelings, but I brought it up now because I have 		no idea what is the reason for this feeling)

Any input can help me understand this feeling that is taking a huge toll on me.

"Thinking Bout seeing the doc just to get myself checked out. Could be old age or poor lifestyle habits but i recently had a panic(?) stress moment that lasted for at least 5minutes until a problem was solved

Background info: only experienced 2-3 occurrences where i found my legs specifically shaking due to nervousness. These experiences are spread very very far apart. 1st time over 10yrs ago fairly minor was just nervous about a new environment &amp; people. 

2nd time was last june 2022 was falling behind online class, thought i couldn’t get set up this program until teacher helped lol and i think this was the main cause of stress (fear of being unable to catch up? Lost?) also deep slow breathing didn’t work here. How to manage lmao

Most recent was few days ago, no leg shaking but just like the 2nd time can’t really think straight, brain wasn’t calming down even though i was breathing normally. Again it was a school related thing, had an IT issue i couldn’t fix, couldnt login to join lecture that was ongoing at the time. Feared missing out important content until i remembered i can watch the recording later but didn’t really get rid of that unpleasant rushed feeling and anxiousness that i need to get this login resolved. Only until i got connected with the school IT helpdesk that i felt completely fine again

I seldom get nervous in job interviews but what is this??? Not sure why my body reacting like this if it’s just fear of falling behind/missing out

3. **Practice self-care:** Take care of your physical and mental health by getting enough sleep, exercising, and eating well.
4. **Seek support:** Talk to friends, family, or colleagues about your stress or consider seeking professional help.
5. **Practice mindfulness:** Take a few moments to focus on your breathing or meditate to help reduce stress and increase focus.

"Before anyone asks, no, the problem is not coming from my supervisor. He’s kind, willing to help and available for me. 

If you ask me I wouldn’t even say that I feel stressed before the meetings, in the sense that I’m not overthinking, I’m not having this bowl of stress in my belly that one could have facing pressure. 

Yet I don’t know why, systematically, 10-5 minutes before the meeting, I go to the toilet and I throw up everything I have, even if I had a light breakfast before. I really don’t know what can I do to stop this because it doesn’t feel like the problem is coming from me. It feels like I have no other choice but to throw up. 

Obviously it’s linked to the fact that I’m going to apply to a PhD and the fact that he’s a very knowledgeable man in his field, and there’s probably a bit of impostor syndrome playing. But what’s worrying me is the fact that of all the 10-12 meetings we had so far, I systematically throw up. I’ve had other meetings with other supervisors when I was a research assistant for instance and it didn’t happen probably because the stakes are lower.

"In my work as a hypnotherapist most of my clients are mature adults experiencing issues rooted in anger, anxiety, depression - or a mixture of these. Often, they are wondering if their present issues are linked to their childhood experiences. More often than not, the answer is yes. 

Research carried out since the end of the last century has led to a greater understanding of how adverse childhood experiences impact on long term wellbeing – both physical and psychological. The key findings are:

· Childhood trauma is very common: even in so-called well-to-do areas.

· There is a direct link between childhood trauma and chronic disease in adulthood.

· The more types of trauma a child experiences, the greater the risk of them of experiencing social and emotional problems as adults.

· Those who experience childhood trauma often experience more than one type of trauma.

You can calculate your own ACEs score by responding to the following questions. Give yourself 1 point for each question where you experienced that category of trauma before your eighteenth birthday. 

1. Emotional abuse: Did a parent or other adult often or very often insult, demean, belittle, humiliate, verbally assault, or threaten to physically assault You? 

2. Physical abuse: Did a parent or other adult often or very often grab, slap, push, or hit You? 

3. Sexual abuse: Did a parent, adult, or someone at least five years older than you ever touch your body in a sexual way or attempt or have oral, anal, or vaginal intercourse with You? 

4. Emotional neglect: Did You often or very often feel that no one in your family loved you or thought you were important; or your family did not look out for each other, feel close to each other, and support each other? 

5. Physical neglect: Did You often not have enough to eat, had to wear dirty clothes, had no one to attend to your medical and dental needs, or had no one to protect you? 

6. Loss of parent: Were your parents separated or divorced, or did you lose a parent for any reason? 

7. Domestic violence: Did You often or very often witness or hear violence between your parents or other adults where someone was being grabbed, shoved, slapped, hit, kicked, had something thrown a them, sexually attacked, or threatened with a weapon? 

8. Family member with addiction: Did You live with anyone who was a problem drinker or alcoholic, who used illicit drugs, or who was addicted to any other substances? 

9. Family member with depression/mental illness: Did you live with anyone who was depressed or mentally ill, attempted or committed self-harm and/or suicide, or hospitalized for mental illness? 

10. Family member incarcerated: Did you live with anyone who went to prison? 

ACES Score (0-10) = 

As ACE scores increase, so does the risk of disease, social and emotional problems. With an ACE score of four or more, things start getting serious. While studies in different locations return slightly different results, the figures suggest around 11% of the population have experienced four or more adverse childhood experiences.  

Fortunately, brains and lives are somewhat plastic. Resilience research shows that the appropriate integration of resilience factors — such as asking for help, developing trusting relationships, forming a positive attitude, listening to feelings — can help people improve their lives. Research in to post traumatic growth has identified five broad areas of growth:

· greater appreciation of life, 

· closer relationships with others, 

· increased personal strength, 

· new possibilities in life, and 

· spiritual “development

Which correlate very closely with the dimensions of wellbeing psychology:

· Positive emotions

· Positive engagement

· Positive relationships

· Positive meaning

· Positive accomplishments

· Positive health","If you’re wondering whether adverse childhood experiences are negatively impacting you as an adult, you probably already know the answer.",0

"Hello all.

I have been on sick leave from work for 3 months now. 
Tomorrow I’m starting slowly again. 3 hours. 

Throughout all January I have had this persistent restlessness. I have been sleeping 4-6 hours every night, woken up, and slept again for 2-4 hours. Getting up at noon. The past two weeks I have tried to get up at 8, to match my work schedule. Now I only sleep 6 hours and stay in bed trying to get in the last two hours. 
It worries me that I’m still not sleeping through a full night.
I’m not sure if it’s stress or my hiatal hernia or my chronic neck pain that wakes me up. But I wake up rather abruptly. So I’m guessing stress. Sometimes I wake up with racing heart.

Speaking of racing heart - I started to get that randomly racing heart throughout the day. I wonder if it’s because I’m starting work and I’m nervous about it. I have social anxiety and I’m trying to fit into this new “me first” mindset. I’m a big people pleaser, but I have had to break with that habit now. Also I keep getting chest pain, I’m not sure if it’s my hiatal hernia or if it’s stress.

Idk what to do. I’m feeling uneasy about not feeling better than I am after 3 months.","Sleeping 6 hours, heart Racing and chest pain",0

"TLDR : 3 questions at end regarding how to not care to disappoint when team and boss have seen my abilities. Boss has high aspirations for me this year or which if I fulfill I’m going to stretch myself so thin that I will leave or go into depression.


I was given a rather good yearly review, and well incentivized, but I am currently stressed, and trying to figure out how to have less responsibilities, when it’s desired I have more. This is above and beyond the rest of my team.

Boss sees my “potential” and not only wants it to continue, but also have me lead more, be more of a driver and influencer, and upgrade my knowledge, cross-team visibility. All of which I do not want. Taking on any more work feels like I’m going to “pop” and I’m already near / at burnout.

I hate disappointing and failing (why I try harder than others on my team; and also why I’m hate being in this position I am right now) but I’m at my max currently near / in burnout, thinking or ways to get out. My mindset is that I’d rather quit a 6fig job and go elsewhere / take a break than disappoint and fail someone whom believes in me so wholeheartedly, and knows how fast I can operate.

Sadly I’ve “shown my hand” this past year of what I’m capable of, but it’s unsustainable for my stress levels, needed downtime, and resetting ability. And more is desired. I’ve mentioned already to the boss that I’m burning the candle at both ends, but it’s only been sprinkled throughout the year. I also hate that I would them regret providing a large optional incentivized reward. Additionally if I fail it’s most likely no more of that and I would just be considered “middle of the road”. I’m OK with that if someone didn’t know my abilities, but again I have pushed past 120% capacity many times for tight deadlines and to get things done.

- How do I change my mindset to not care about disappointing 
- What, if anything, do I tell boss? I feel I need to drop hints that this is too much and if I’m dead it does no one good. ( absolutely sucks feeling capable but also having a hapicapied weakness of stress leading to depression.)

The fall semester ended for me in mid-December, and I resume for the spring semester in a week. I'm reflecting on the time I spent while having absolutely no academic, social, or financial responsibility... to say the very least, I'm not very pleased with how I dedicated my time. Much of it was spent sleeping, binge-watching shows, cooking, and staying inside. I did get some important things done, but I can't help but think, ""why couldn't I have done more?""

" I am a MA level clinical mental health counselor and was recently certified as a Yin Yoga Therapy Instructor. Though I cannot offer individualized/catered sessions, I do provide yin yoga classes on YouTube (@wildheartyogahh) as a free resource to help those who may not be able to afford help in other ways. Many people store emotional energy in the body- specifically in the fascia, since 80% of nerve pathways end in the fascia- and yin targets release of fascia and connective tissue through long (3+ min), passive holds. It is a wonderful, gentle practice, for the mind and body! Hope it can help someone. :)",Yin Yoga is a WONDERFUL Way to Regulate the Nervous System and Manage Stress,0

Another Situation Like The Above :

I have got a girlfriend recently its been like 5 months and we meet in person twice or thrice in a month, and I met her yesterday too, when I am with her I pretty much enjoy everything, the feeling of hugging her, kissing her, and just doing stupid things together, but as soon as I drop her home its like all the memories just fade away, right after I drop her home I forget the feeling of huggin her, kissing her. I usually took this for granted all the time but yesterday after dropping her at her home tears started coming out of my eyes because of how much I hated this. I actually don't have anyone to talk about this with neither can I go to a therapist or whatever, can anyone please please please help me a little bit. 
I will appreciate it a lot.

"I’m dealing with a really bad gut situation . Im only 29 but over the summer I was on a 2 month long holiday eating crap and that’s when my stomach problems started. I had blood on my stool at the end of two months and instead of treating it as a hemmoroid because of crap food I’ve been thinking I have colon cancer. Cut to the next 6 months of constant stress and anxiety and nausea and gut issues. I’ve never got constipated in my life before so I’m stressed about colon cancer and this is making me feel even more worried. 

I’ve been to the doctor and he told me the blood may be due to some minor rectal irritation but nothing to worry about. He didn’t check me physically though. 

All my blood tests and stomach ultrasound is clear but I can’t get over the thought of having colon cancer as whenever I’m constipated there’s been blood. 

I’m an extreme hypochondriac and im going through one of the most stressful times of my life and im worried I have colon cancer twenty four seven. Im constantly naseous and I have cramps. My stomach hasn’t been the same in 7 months and I never had this problem earlier. 

Current symptoms : stomach cramps, inability to empty stomach, blood on toilet paper, swollen anus( I can feel a swelling in the area), lots of acid reflux, constantly , and constipated 

Current Mental State// Life Problems: My dad’s company shut down over night 5 Years ago- both my parents  literally have  0 money and we come from quite a upper class background from back in the day. They have no idea how to move forward in the future, I’ve had back to back 4 traumatic relationships where I feel like I’ve only been dumped because of the troubles my dad is facing and no one wants to be a part of this kind of a family. I’ve had men enter my lives, totally support me and fly away with all my trust broken back to back and all of this has broken me. I also saw my best friend pass away in a freak fire accident 3 years ago. All my friends are married / getting married and I feel constantly alone and sad. I can’t cope 
I run my own company and I’m independent enough to live my life currently - but there’s no security for the future and I’m just constantly feeling like I’m racing with time to make ends meet. I feel like no one understands the place I am in physically and mentally and my physical health is making me unable to work mentally - and if I don’t work I won’t be able to sustain myself. 

I used to be a go getter- constantly at the gym and now I struggle to get out of bed. I have no answers on what’s happening to me .

The last time I saw fresh blood was in JULY and now again In December. It’s fresh and very little but enough to make my mind spiral and think I’m dying/ I can’t switch off my brain and I’m constantly burning - farting and have reflux too! 

Do you think stress / anxiety are making my symptoms worse? I love to drink and I can’t even touch a drink thinking my stomach will spasm and bleed which makes me even more nervous and anxious. I’m at a loss of words and I can’t live a normal life. I want to switch off from the thought that I have a serious disease.

"UPDATE IN COMMENTS: I’m a college student from out of state. I left home because I didn’t like the environment I was in, and being out of state was one of the best options. I don’t have a car and it’s mostly a public transportation type place so it’s not the biggest issue. I don’t ask people for rides unless I really need them. If we go out, I’ll tell them we can take the bus. On rare occasions if I need it I’ll ask for a ride. I was getting close to someone and only then did I ask them to take me to target twice, once we went, the other we didn’t and the second time I really needed to go for a project. So you kinda get the jist of it. When I need to go to and from the airport I has rely on others, this is one are I need help in because Ubers are so expensive (also I only need it after and before the winter, summer, and one thanksgiving break). I generally don’t care too much about it’s safety because I feel it’s generally safe, but this one time it’s kind of an issue. 

I also would like to mention that I don’t really have friends in school. 

Anyways, I ended up contacting many MANY people. They all basically said no. The flight would come in at around 12 AM and none of them could pick me up. I honestly got angry. My thought process was that I’m literally in a bad situation, I need a ride, and no one can either wake up or cut their plans short? It honestly just made me so frustrated. I get im not your best friend, but a girl taking an Uber at 12AM-1AM isn’t okay for many. I’m not the type to go out a lot so it’s uncomfortable for me. 

I get it’s late at night, but it just made me feel like people are selfish. I hope I never treat others the way I feel when I ask others for a ride. Because it feels terrible, and I’m not saying these people are the exact reason why I feel this way. I’m sure it’s an accumulation, but it just feels so terrible. 

I hate having to beg and pry and ask. I hate asking for a ride so I do try my best to get there myself. I even offer to pay because I don’t want people to do it for free and then me feel like I’m always bothering them.

I don’t know what to do, I know I’m emotional about this but people who have cars and give others a ride should try and be more empathetic to those who don’t.",To those who give car rides,0

"So last year, I went to a diner with my gf and I had myself a cappuccino for the first time. I've never tasted anything so delicious and I made it a goal to learn how to go about making one. After Christmas, I got myself an espresso machine. It would be a few months before I used it (lack of space where I live) but I finally got it set up back in November. My first drink, well... I never used a steam wand before. I watched some YouTube videos, my second cup was EXACTLY like what I had at that diner. Now I make about 3 cups a week or so (usually to keep warm more than anything) and it's expanding to where I got a coffee grinder so I'm not restricted by grind. If I want whole beans, I can work with them now. If I'm unsure what grind the bag I have is, pour some in the grinder to make sure.

Was it expensive? Well, getting everything together was about $260. With all the payment apps out there, it's affordable. You can make tons of stuff too. Lattes, mochas, I'll make hot chocolate with this thing. And I love it. If I have guests, I always offer to make them something. I found zen in the process, satisfaction in these product, and a desire to expand on what I know. It really makes me feel better knowing I can make something that not only I can enjoy, but friends and family can as well.

My advice? Learn a craft that you enjoy. If you like painting or even coloring, there's plenty of resources. If you like writing, maybe get a voice recorder for story ideas that pop up and expand on that for a bit. If you like food, all kinds of classes out there.

"I’m 13 and for the past 5 months , since august, I haven’t been able to sleep properly and my period has completely gone and my hairs falling out a lot  and I’m positive it’s because of stress . The problem is idk what actually causing my stress because I have so many problems 

I’ve had blood tests and they just said I have  anaemia (low iron). 

I’m always anxious when I can’t sleep because I start ruminating about the consequences of poor sleep and that makes it harder to sleep but idk if that anxiety around sleep is causing my stress 

Even when I do have a good nights sleep I still feel nervous and can’t seem to calm down I’m always stuck in my head and can’t seem to enjoy the present moment because I’m always listening to my negative thoughts 

There have been so many things wich  overwhelm me , like my moms 39 weeks pregnant with her 6th kid and my parents don’t have time to give me attention and they don’t believe that I’m struggling mentally.
And I’ve recently had a fall out with a friend and now she’s spreading rumours about me and my sister keeps body shaming me when I’m already struggling with body image and calories 

Everything makes me feel so overwhelmed and I don’t know how to cope anymore I have no adults  I can tell this to except my parents who don’t give af and I have no family where I live

Personality is defined as the collection of behavior, attitude, and ways of expressing emotions that makes a person unique. We can identify if a person is with a good personality or not based on the outer expression of inner feelings. If you want to become a better and successful person in life, be it professional or personal, building up on personality is a good place to start.

Only meds I've tried is low grade anxiety meds. And I'm unsure what bloods. My doc ran more thursday, said he'd call if anything was different. They tested for that one thing that starts with a T that checks for damage in the heart or recent HA's. 
And during the echocardiogram my Hr was 130. She noted it was fast but then 2 weeks later I get a call. Holter didn't show anything super concerning and the echo was fine. I am under tons of anxiety and stress but whatever is going on has had me bed ridden with neck pain, dizziness, headaches and heart discomfort . The fast HR and pounding feeling for literally months essentially with no breaks. My entire life has been Halted because I can't do anything. I take a shower and my heart goes a million miles an hour and my blood pressure goes to the 140's over 90. Brain fog and dizziness. Tinnitus like crazy and this weird whooshing sound and pain from my neck .
It all started with going to the doctor bc I had Thunderclap headaches after orgasm, which lasted everytime for 2 weeks then just stopped. Then I started feeling worse and that stopped but all this started. I've had an echocardiogram, several EKGs from the ER visits, an MRI 3 months ago no contrast, a CT with contrast of my chest and neck last month, a CT with contrast of my head last week. Noone can find anything. Only suggestion my doc had Thursday was potentially ICP and he looked worri3d that's what it was and said if I get a headache go to the er. Which I did 2 days ago to which they didn't do bloodwork but they did a CT and Xray . Tested my eye movement . Then gave me a shot and sent me home. 
I obviously need to continue to see my doctor and will. Just 4 months of this I'm trying to reach out for things to recommend to my doctor to test for and try because they're struggling hard. The only things I can even think of personally anymore is craniocervical instability, anxiety, and maybe clogged artery issues. With the ICP he thought, which is phesable I have 95 percent of the symptoms but the numerous head CTs and the MRI showing no pressure(doesn't rule it out) and the fact that it's been 4 months since it all began and I've not stroked out or anything makes it seem not entirely sure for me personally.

Hey! Ok, I ask you to read below and try to put yourself in my situation.

2021-04-13:
Long story short. Had been suffering from a long-lasting cough (5-6 weeks) and sought care. The doctor heard something on the left lung and sent me for an urgent x-ray the same day.  I was terrified and thought I had lung cancer.  I was nervous and scared to death until I got my test results back.  It showed nothing but I recovered a few days later.

2021-09-14:
My wife found a liver spot/mole on my back that looked weird. This after I had complained of itching in that place 1-2 months earlier. Thought it was skin cancer and was nervous and scared to death for several weeks before I received an answer that there was no danger. The mole didn't look ""bad"" so they didn't do anything about it.

2021-10-07:
My wife finds a lump on the right shoulder blade, size approx. 1x1 cm. It can be moved but feels strange somehow.  Immediately becomes completely convinced that this is also a cancerous tumor.  Either the skin cancer has spread or it is a sarcoma (soft tissue cancer that can feel exactly like a fatty lump). Once again, I became very nervous, stressed and scared to death. I sought care and was able to see a reputable doctor who informed me that it was a lipoma. When he was about to take it away, he says he can't find it.  I imagined he saw it and it wasn't a lipoma.  He said something to the other doctor and I didn't really understand where.  He you catch me again and the lump is still there.  Instead, he sends me for an urgent MR X-ray and here I am completely destroyed.  I take him as if he has seen something that makes him not dare to cut me.  I lie at home and shake for several days and have such fear of death that it is completely sick. I end up trying to go into that X-ray tunnel but it doesn't work. Tries 3-4 times but I just lie there and cry because I'm afraid of what the x-ray will show.  Here I am completely convinced that it is cancer of some kind.  I had to cancel everything and today the lump is still there.  The doctor called me 3 weeks later and said he was 100% sure it was a lipoma and that it can stay on my body without doing any harm. So, I still have it and I'm alive.

During this course of ""diseases"" I get hemorrhoids and start having stomach problems.  I still have huge problems with my stomach (heartburn, acid regurgitation, irregular stools, stomach pain, stomach cramps, etc.).

I'm simply wondering if this could be the result of some kind of stress, nervousness, panic disorder, death anxiety over an extended period of time?

Note: I have never before had ""problems"" with my stomach (that I know of) but after the above events it is in total revolt.

Please write a line or two what you think.

Sorry for a long post, but it's important and nice for me to write a little.

"I’ve been struggling recently with stress and anxiety about life in general. I’m having constant headaches and migraines, I’m not sleeping well, I’m overeating…

I’m 21 years old and I’m already feeling burnt out and ready to give up. I work a full time job and go to school part time. I just moved out of my parents house 2 months ago and got an apartment with my boyfriend. I get stuck doing majority of the housework like laundry, dishes, cleaning, and grocery shopping. My dad works all day long and my mom doesn’t drive so Im constantly driving my mom and my younger siblings every where. 

I work 6:30am-3pm and I usually don’t even get to sit and relax until 7pm, then Im going to bed by 8pm but i’m not falling asleep until midnight and Im up on and off all throughout the night. 

Im barely making enough money to pay my bills, and Im also the family bank to my mom and dad. Don’t get me wrong I don’t mind helping them out but they’re constantly asking to borrow money and 9 times out of 10 I don’t get it back.

"2 months ago I had a terrible fall resulting in a broken shoulder that hopefully will make a full recovery. Nerve is bruised so it’s a fairly useless arm at the moment.

Life has been strange being off work and at home. I can’t drive for now. Family has been visiting and helping drive me around for errands and appointments. most friends are settling down with a family, have moved, or are career focused etc. so I haven’t seen anyone except a best friend. Everything else has been distant communication like the odd text here and there (when it’s external of family and the best friend, that is).

It’s miraculous I didn’t hit my head. In fact it kind of puzzles me, but I was blacked out drunk (working on recovery now).

It dawned on me that maybe my existence for the past 2 months has been in a coma. That I’m in a hospital bed on life support; surrounded by family; experiences with family are my mind manifesting their conversations they have around me. 

Everything is just a manifestation of my mind but I’m actually in a coma.

I’m weirded out and there are several triggers that cause me to second guess myself.

Edit: some of the triggers I mean include that groceries is symbolism for nutrients/IV time, my parents visiting in life are just visiting me in a hospital, friends who I no longer speak with recently have actually said their good byes; an ex lover I always thought about getting back together with finally blocked me out after 4 years - I got disconnected.

Right now my friends and family are gone, family is on a trip at the moment. That may be symbolism that they too, have left. For now or ever I’m unsure.

I recently started talking a lot more with one of my brothers - but were talking about old video games and nostalgia. Everything I know about him in the present has sort of been static.

"It takes more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety.

### Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**Identify what you can and can’t control.** List your issues in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control. 

**Focus on solutions.** Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.

**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly, deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule, deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**Communicate.** With your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.

**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations, that you’re on your way to calmer times, that you’re learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**Blow off some steam.** Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s sleep.

**Get your rest.** Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list. 

**Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward.  
 

**Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however, it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.**",Feeling Overwhelmed?,0

"I know life is supposed to be difficult. I know stressful things can happen, and that most of us learn how to cope in a healthy way. Eating right and exercising are supposed to make us healthy and happy, both physically and mentally. We're supposed to have hobbies (beginner at knitting) to keep us occupied and to do our duties, which manifests in the job that I do almost every day. We need to have a network of support from friends and family. Life isn't just what happens to you, it's how you react to it. That's what I tell myself.

Yet it seems that life, or at least my life, is just one stressful event after another. Be it getting rear-ended and struggling with insurance for a few months, a single parent's boyfriend showing up who stresses you out for the next few, transferring from one branch to another in your job, looming deadlines, and the knowledge that you have to eat healthily and sleep at least 8 hours a night or you're going to get sick...etc. etc. etc. Many times I'm happy and I catch myself wondering when the next bad thing is going to happen. WITHOUT FAIL, it does. I deal with it successfully, and it's on to the next one! Over and over and over again, catching moments of pleasure and peace in between. It's not a very good comparison, but it's kind of like Dark Souls, where you die your way through instead of playing your way through.

I'm slowly being chipped away at. I've built an extraordinarily healthy way of living, but it seems at this point that it's just a tower I've built over a foundation under continuous assault by the elements that I'm constantly repairing.

I've been tired. So tired. It's like I died a long time ago, and I'm only 23. I know everybody deals with constant stressors, so is everyone secretly feeling this way? Is it all drowned in alcohol? drugs? Religion? Are we supposed to naturally numb ourselves with age? This can't be all that life is!

My grandfather eats junk food. He stands or sits around for most of the day and sometimes he goes for a walk before coming home and eating. He's been through the Vietnam war and lost almost everything. Despite sleep apnea, cancer, a fat-rich diet, and falling once, he's still thriving in his eighties. No one gets to that point unless they've got it all figured out inside.

There's something obvious I'm missing, something that appears to make all the difference. I don't think a girlfriend will fix this, nor will any big purchases or materialism. Ideally, I'd have a life of inner peace and contentment, filled with steady but peaceful determination. Otherwise, life has no meaning to it.",Is this all life is supposed to be?,0

This is the 9th year I will be living with my mom. I never thought it would be almost a decade!!

She stresses me out like no one else can. And that is not only wanting to do every little thing for me, but also affording me ver little privacy.

Also, I am never ever just relaxing. This is probably the reason my shoulders and neck are stiff as a plank, my weight doesn't go down, always tired, always on the verge of tears, and a few other minor health issues (let's hope they don't become bigger issues!)

I had been working in a shitty workplace. The pay ain't bad but to deal with my boss terrible management and temperament which makes his employee turnover rate is so high .People would stay around for a week up to 3-4 months, with the group chat kept having people leave and join. As of now there are around 15 people who have come and gone which I seen since the first day I joined and worked here up until now. I heard that this business has been running for 4-5 years now but from what I seen is almost like an enterprenuerial business with no idea and direction they wanted to do as they have tutoring, selling board games/blind boxes and even large figurine tradings, throwing menial tasks at every employee with focus on trying to get more employees to join. I worked around 11-12 hours on average so it makes me stressed at first.

Then a few days ago when I got home from work (around 11pm almost midnight) my dad called me in to have a talk with him, then he explains that he's worried about my health and my body health. At first I didn't think about it much. Me and my father didn't go well for a long time so I think of it more as of a warning, however it turned to make me angry and stressed as he simulate what will happen to me by imagining if I were turned into a disabled person and unable to move at all, with me still able to talk. I got so stressed and tired enough that I didn't get enough sleep after I finally got to excuse myself.

And comes up to today as I had enough with today as I tend after their store and I was a little loopy, I looked like I was sleeping when I'm actually trying to stay awake. The owner called me that he's been watching me sleeping for 15 minutes and he's going to cut my pay. Then he ordered me to go to wash my face. i did before coming back, so angry and annoyed that I slapped the store's security camera, HARD. Luckily it didn't break just the camera cable disconnected so it's an easy fix. So I just called the manager and told them that the camera accidentally fell to the ground and broke, saying that it worked fine after I reassembled it. I was a little panicked but a little less stressful from that.

"i've been so negligent with everything in my life. my head feels full. i neglected applying for leave early enough and was called out in front of my entire team (indirectly. my name wasn't mentioned). i'm wondering why i did that?? why did i delay applying for simple leave? i feel so guilty and ashamed, but i also have the feeling that i'm beating myself up too much for it 

though, this isn't an isolated incident.

i was meant to deliver assets to another team but neglected to double-check if we had all the assets to deliver. instead, i ignored the issue. the team eventually called me out for it. ideally I should've flagged the issue and had them deal with it... but i was just too lazy?? it wasn't even a big deal. nothing arduous, but i got too lazy. what's worse is that I didn't own up to my mistake.

"I wonder if I’m the only one sometimes going through all this . Anyway I’m a 35 year old male living in Los Angeles working soon will have my own apartment in a few months because of my autism ( though most people don’t know I’m autistic). I have a roommate currently. I am originally from the sf Bay Area and while I loved it there I needed a change . Weather for one thing and LA just seemed so exciting and it is . Anyway I moved here in 2018 and love it . So I’m happy in the city I live in , but I’m not happy with the circumstances of the last two years and instead of looking back I’m trying to look forward and realize my lie isn’t over and boring and useless. First off I used to go the gym and run and eat healthy, and I was in much better shape  obviously. Than Covid came my work hours changed and so did my diet along with everything else. I work retail so those who work it or have will know exactly what I’m talking about. So in 2022 I tried to restart by going back to being a vegetarian, forcing myself to go back to the gym etc, but my motivation is just not there yet . I do have a small social life so I’m thankful for that and I am also a photographer as I love all the architecture in this city . But I need more friends my age I’m
Guessing and there just seem to be no women who aren’t partiers or who would let me be myself with them . Or maybe I’m looked at as asexual or unattractive. Anyways I just need something more exciting than just work and home . I wish I had a group o could do things with but of course my schedule makes it tough .

My dating/sex history:
I was never very good at asking women out even though most of my life I was told I was extremely handsome I’m tall 6”1 blonde hair , brown eyes . I was told I could have modeled when I was younger . Anyway I didn’t lose my virginity till I was 20 which is late but partly because i was shy , just not confident. I had an opportunity to be that girls boyfriend who I lost my virginity to but I just decided I didn’t want a relationship with her , well between 2007 and 2009 I had no heterosexual sex but desired it but was insecure, etc . I’ll admit because I grew up in San Francisco and had gay friends I even experimented with gay men as a way out since I was just not having relationships with women but I realized obviously I was not gay or bi since I didn’t feel attracted to men . Than I’m 2010 I had sex with a drunk cougar and that was one and done . I had a disasterous date with a woman in the mission district in sf and it was horrible. I than tried going to “ cougar bars” with my friend but of course we would never go home with anyone, and it wasn’t my scene anyway. Than in 2012 I met my first girlfriend who was older than me at a class. Funny thing is I liked her immediately and she clearly liked me . We saw the Batman dark knight movie which was our first date in 2012. Well we fucked like crazy so much so that I felt it was a bit much and the non sexual side of our relationship seemed kinda ehhh….
Well I eventually drove her away and regretted it . And since then I’ve slept with a few older women from 2015-2019. But since Covid I’ve had no sex except masturbation . Partly I still do struggle with being insecure and feeling like Women will never be into me which I know is nonsense of course . But I am now have a strange sense of being torn on one hand I would like to be in a relationship, on the other hand my life is busy enough with work and exploring stuff in LA with my camera . I almost feel like the woman would have to be perfect for me because I feel like maybe my earlier history told me something that I’m just someone who lost their virginity late and because of it maybe it messed me up or maybe I’m better off just with a few friends and my own life . Partly I think I need someone who I can be myself around them without judgment and I’m trying to change . Maybe I’m just to weird or absent minded . I try to work on my confidence and I try to
Fake it till I make it but that can only last so long . I do have confidence issues and while I’m secretive about it deep inside I feel like most women are either judging me or think I’m unattractive , or that I’m gay. 

I guess I need to work on myself . I want to get back into shape , eat healthier, exercise like I used to . Also I use to shave everyday clean shaven and short hair but when Covid came I got lazy. I’m going to try and get myself together and work on myself. I take my medication for depression which helps and I do have a therapist but I can’t see her as much as I’d like . I do have challenges but I always try to work through them 

My issues with sex, relationships, asking women out :
I have often had issues with asking women out , etc. it’s weird maybe I am incel yet I don’t blame my problems on women I blame it all on myself that I’m my own worst enemy. I tend to shoot myself in the foot . It’s weird because I don’t consider myself repressed. I grew up in a liberal household in San Francisco. I also am not a right winger as most incels are . I am liberal . Anyways so most men can ask a woman out with no problem and nothing would faze them . I on the other hand have trouble because I don’t want to make a fool of myself, come off as creepy etc . Good example is there is this customer at work who I like and comes in most everyday . Her and I talk quite a bit when I’m helping her and we smile at each other . And I think she likes me , but probably just being friendly. Two of my colleagues know I like her and always ask “ Have you asked her out yet “ I always give an excuse or that she wouldn’t want to have anything to do with me that way.  So other guys could just ask a woman out with no issue but not me. Also I’m not at my best right now and want to get back to being healthy and exercise. The funny thing is I can talk to beautiful women because I do every day because I work in Beverly Hills and I can engage and be friendly but on my own I don’t seek out to talk to women because of my own fear as how they view me. The funny thing is I did ask my ex gf out but it wasn’t really a “date asking her out it was more casual and things developed. I just wonder if I can overcome these issues that have been plaguing me for a good chunk of my life . I just sometimes feel I’m cursed .h",How can I change my current ( most of my life) situation?,0

"Cant lie i got offered a “office cleaning job” full time, and good pay so i took it. Ive done cleaning since i was 17 and just stuck with it because its easy and most of the time your left alone to just do your job in peace and go home. I’m 21 now and never had a cleaning job like this. So i turn up for my 1st day and was greeted by a woman and a confused looking bloke. She said “firstly have we got safety shoes and a hi vis?” I looked at her confused. “No?” Long story short i was never told to bring either of the things, because like i said i was told it was an office cleaning job, so she gave me a hi vis and some borrowed shoes that were massive on me, which i had to wear for 3 days because again wasnt told i needed safety shoes an i was broke af. She took me into a huge warehouse with different compartments and said this is what ill be cleaning. Along with rooms connected to the warehouse that operate massive machinery making car parts. 

She told this confused bloke that had only been there for a week to show me around, this guy had no clue what he was doing tbh, just pointed at things and told me i had to “empty bins that way”. Later i was then told i had to drive around this fucking monster of a cleaning machine in tight rooms, never had proper training on this thing btw just got told what buttons to press and to just practice. Yeah sure I’ll just practice not crashing a giant machine into stacks of metal cages whilst also dodging death. I have crashed this machine not badly luckily but have definitely been in situations that couldve killed me. The thing that really pissed me off is the fact i was struggling on driving this thing today, the supervisor who was meant to be helping me, didnt want to help me (laughed and shyed away) when i was panicking on the machine cos i couldnt get it through this gap and i didnt want to crash into big metal boxes that couldve fell on me. She got on it and started getting nervous herself being on it and hated driving it just as much as i do, then started mocking how i have to drive it and she doesnt. Keep in mind shes meant to have fucking trained me to use it.

"So there's this guy. An ex ss officer. He fell in love with a jewish prisoner in Auschwitz and had a relationship with her. After the war he tried to contact her to be with him, but she wanted nothing more to do with him, so he started a new life, family, got married . He had this one picture ofher(in her auschwitz prisoner uniform) , and he used to cut out her head and put her on another clothing, away from Auschwitz. He used to do this for the most of his life (the filmaker says it was a way for him to imagine an alternative life they could have had).He copied the picture and kept it in his wallet until the day he died. So when his daughter was 16 she said her father told her about this Jewish girl, and that he never ever in his life felt true love like that. He even gave his daughter a locket with a picture of him and his ex Jewish girlfriend, not her mother. His daughter said it was odd, and she also said that this Jewish girl was the love of his life(in a documentary, there was a documentary made about them). So the filmmaker which is close to both his and Jewish girls families said that the ss officer was deeply and truly in love in this Jewish girl, till the day he died. His wife also knew about his ex.So in 1972 he had to go to the court because of his war crimes against humanity, and his ex Jewish girlfriend was a witness,when he saw her after 30 years of no contact he started to cry.

 **How Mindfulness replaces medication to reduce anxiety**

Care works similarly as well as a prescription to check nervousness, concentrate on finds

A care contemplation course might be as successful at lessening uneasiness as a typical medicine, as per another review.

The exploration, distributed on November 9 in JAMA Psychiatry, involved a gathering of 276 grown-ups with untreated uneasiness problems. A big part of the patients was haphazardly chosen to take 10 to 20 mg of escitalopram, the nonexclusive type of Lexapro, a typical medicine used to treat nervousness and wretchedness. The other half were relegated to an eight-week course in care-based pressure decrease.

The outcomes were dazzling: The two gatherings experienced about a 20% decrease in their tension side effects over the eight-week time span.

Elizabeth Hoge, the lead creator on the review and the overseer of the Tension Issues Exploration Program at Georgetown College Clinical Center, let CNN know that she trusts the examination can open up greater treatment choices for patients with uneasiness.

I work at a gym in the daycare center and as of late we’ve been getting an influx of gym members, which in turn means more children.  At my gym we have two different rooms for childcare. We have a childcare room for toddlers (where I work) and then we have “kids club” for elementary school age kids. There is more than the age difference between the two rooms. Kids club is a much larger room and has more mature toys such as monster high dolls, Jenga, and a giant connect four. This room is better equipped for a larger group of kids. The other room is basically a glorified supply closet which is perfect for small children.

Tips to Deal with  Stress:  
\-**Explore your triggers**: Keep a diary for one week to discover which situations increase your stress levels the most.  
\-**Practice time management**: Trying to do everything at once isn't an effective way to handle stress as it usually takes you longer to complete your tasks. Ensure that you are organised by managing your time efficiently.  
**-Set boundaries:** It's easy to be available 24 hours a day due to current technology. Establish some boundaries so work is distanced from your personal life.  
**-Life outside of work:** To avoid experiencing burnout you must take some time to look after yourself and engage in activities you enjoy.  
**-Build a support network:** Speaking with and meeting up with friends and family can help you feel more positive and reduce your vulnerability to stress.  
**-Focus on healthy habits:** Avoid alcohol, caffeine and nicotine, get enough sleep, eat well and be active.

**-Do a course:** There are plenty of courses available that will teach you to understand the symptoms and causes of stress, steps you can take to deal with your stress and will help you practice dealing with stressful situations in the safety of exercises. For example, **VirtualSpeech** is offering a free trial for their Managing Workplace Stress course and **FutureLearn** also offers a Workplace Wellbeing course.",7 Tips to Deal with Stress,0
"Or is it just me? 

I have two blood/circulatory, autoimmune disorders that are not that difficult to regulate, but can get annoying sometimes because I often have to go to more appointments than I’d like. Also, depending on the job, I may have to ask for accommodations. 

The last manager that I asked for an accommodation basically insinuated that I was lying, and even when I proved it with a doctors note, she was still very rude about it, and acted like I was asking for something ridiculous other than needing to get up every two hours and walk around for five minutes because of my poor circulation. 

I have been let go in the past due to taking time off for medical conditions, but of course they don’t say that it’s because of medical condition they just say I’m taking “too much time off.” So I can’t claim ADA discrimination. 

I’ve been at my new job for a little over a year now and they are so flexible and have no issues with me taking time off but of course I built up this wall because of previous jobs and I’m always terrified to ask for time off when I need to go to a doctors appointment. 

My doctor is like “your health is more important than your job and you need to make this work so that you can do everything you need to do to handle your autoimmune diseases.” Obviously, my health is more important than a job but he doesn’t think about the fact that companies don’t give a shit about health and if I lose my job due to taking time off, I won’t be able to afford insurance or pay out-of-pocket for him.

"While fear, shock, and disgust are typically seen as negative emotions that we want to avoid, they can also be an enjoyable experience in certain situations.

Horror movies are one of the best examples of this. When you’re watching a horror movie about ghosts, zombies, serial killers, aliens, or monsters, your nervous system naturally kicks into gear as if you’re experiencing a real threat from your environment.

**This** [**fight, flight, or freeze**](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/the-complete-guide-to-daily-stress/)**-response creates a biochemical rush of adrenaline, endorphins, and dopamine, which can create a type of “natural high.”**

However, while your body experiences the “natural high” of a real threat, your brain knows deep down that you’re actually safe and secure – and there’s no real danger present.

One early [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00995932) published in the journal *Motivation and Emotion* looked into why people enjoy eating really spicy foods (such as chili peppers) and found a similar response.

Chili enjoyers still feel the same irritation and pain of eating spicy foods as everyone else, but they enjoy the rush of adrenaline and endorphins it produces. It stimulates the body’s “warning system” in a harmless and risk-free way that can be exciting and exhilarating.

This type of [positive thrill-seeking](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/positive-thrill-seeking/) can be found in many other relatively safe and harmless activities, such as riding rollercoasters, extreme sports, skydiving, an intense workout, or playing competitive video games.

**New psychology research shows that the experience of negative emotions (in a safe and controlled context) can be very enjoyable and beneficial.**

One [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30307264/) published in the scientific journal *Emotion* found that “voluntarily arousing negative emotions” (VANE) – such as purposely making ourselves scared – can lead to an overall boost in mood, like when we watch a horror movie or visit a haunted house.

The study looked at individuals who bought tickets for an “extreme haunted house” event, which was designed to elicit a variety of negative emotions such as anxiety, fear, shock, and disgust.

After the “haunted house” experience, most individuals reported an overall boost in euphoria and positive mood, especially if they felt tired, bored, or stressed beforehand.

While the sample is biased (people who buy tickets to haunted houses are more likely to enjoy them), the study does reveal that some people genuinely enjoy scaring themselves.

Furthermore, the study found that individuals who enjoyed the haunted house experience also showed less stress while completing subsequent cognitive and emotional tests (including showing less reactivity in the brain during those tests, as measured by EEG recordings).

Researchers theorize that “voluntarily arousing negative emotions” (VANE) can teach us how to better deal with future stress and anxiety.

This is a common technique behind a lot of *exposure therapy*, where a person is gradually put into a fearful situation so they become more “desensitized” to some irrational fear or phobia. For example, a person scared of flying may be asked by a therapist to visualize themselves getting on a plane until they learn to manage their fear better.

By actively exposing ourselves to fear, shock, or disgust in a safe and controlled way, we get to practice regulating these emotions in the moment, which is an important pillar of [emotional intelligence](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/4-fundamental-pillars-of-emotional-intelligence/).

**Horror movies** ***simulate*** **extraordinary experiences that we normally wouldn’t have in the real world. When we watch a horror movie, we put ourselves in the protagonist’s position and ask ourselves,** ***“What would I do in this situation?”***

New research shows fans of horror movies may even be more prepared to face real-world catastrophes.

One fascinating [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7492010/) published in *Personality and Individual Differences* discovered that fans of “horror movies” and “pandemic movies” were more resilient during the COVID pandemic. It was also found that fans of “prepper” genres in particular (alien-invasion, apocalyptic, and zombie films) exhibited both greater resilience and preparedness.

This is one reason why “pandemic” movies such as *Contagion* and *28 Days Later* showed a huge spike in popularity during COVID.

Ultimately, horror movies give us a chance to face our fears and practice [mentally rehearsing](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/mental-rehearsal-changing-habits-through-the-power-of-visualization/) how we would respond in extremely intense situations. As the famous horror writer Stephen King once said, “A good horror story help us understand our own deepest fears.”","The Psychology of Horror Movies: Why People Enjoy Being Scared, Shocked, and Disgusted",0

When it comes to dealing with stress, we’re often told the best things we can do are exercise, make time for our favorite activities, or try meditation or mindfulness.

But the kinds of foods we eat may also be an effective way of dealing with stress, according to research published by me and other members of APC Microbiome Ireland.

Our latest study has shown that eating more fermented foods and fiber daily for just four weeks had a significant effect on lowering perceived stress levels.

"I am 28 years old and my birthday is tomorrow. I am not the one who cares much about my age or celebrates it. However i am having a very bad week and seem too stressed out. 

To start with, i was on a weekend trip with my girl friends to relax and meet after 2 long years. It was fun. But i am always the 3rd wheel in that friendship. They both are nice to me and they wish well for me. But i am the complete opposite of them. They are funny , crack jokes , extrovert and i am none of it. I just listen to them and enjoys the company sort of. They are good looking and can carry themselves. I am bit on the fatty side and does not look much good in the pictures. I think it always bothers me. 

Anyways , i come back from the trip and thought to stay with my boyfriend for some days. I feel lonely even when he is around. He gets very excited about his work and talks continuously about it. I am very much discouraged and demotivated by it even though i should not. He helped with a lot of stuff at work. I keep wondering why i am not excited as much as he is. I am interested in doing my work but i am not an expert. Just an average person at work. But i am a team lead too and the management part of comes easily for me. 

I normally handles the new joinee mentorship, any documentations, managing the team calls , setting up sessions. Somewhat what a culture team would do. I like doing this but i don't want to be known for it. Anyways past week, my department head called me up and said he sending some names selected for attending a training and asked to review it. I thought I might be in it but i was not. Every lead except me which made me very sad. I do not know why i was not even considered. I am not that bad. Yet again. 

This all happened when i was still at my boyfriend's place. I don't think he knows i was struggling with all this negative vibes happening. Still i thought i will hold my head high. I started going through my drive which the girls uploaded the pics of us. I don't normally go through it. I thought i might as well because my sister was asking for pics. So i selected some which i looked better with them. I thought i will send some good ones and some bad ones for the fun of it. The moment i send it, she replied telling me i look terrible in it. That I have put on too much weight and no one would tell this to my face. By that point, i was breaking down. I was crying hard and was feeling so much heavy in my heart. I was with my boyfriend and yet he does not know my heart was breaking with all the pain. I don't if i should blame him or I should have gone to him. May be he does not know i am struggling and i am not willing to tell him my struggles. 

So i texted my sister back, "" yup, i know"". I don't think she know i was upset. Then my second sister texted me saying i should take care of my health. Our family has diabetes genes. She was telling me the same thing. I was okay with her msging but i am very upset with the other sister for bitching about my weight. I only send pics to her. 

This all happened on Friday. At work, i did literally nothing. I could not do anything. I keep thinking about hypothetical scenarios and to wishful thinking if i could just leave everything behind. It was so much pain. 

Tomorrow is my birthday and i want to be alone..just alone. I don't know what to do. I don't know if this birthday is the thing that's making me miserable. But honestly i am not worried about getting aged. I am just tired. I know I should not expect people to come to you. But oh man I wish i could have someone who can feel me and i can open up to. I know i have people to talk. People will listen to me. But i can't open up to them. Everything is bottled up inside and i am so so stressed and sad and what not.

"So, I’m currently super stressed and I don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to. I’ve suffered with depression for a long time and I recently got a puppy. I’ve wanted another dog for about 10 years and I thought it was a good time to get one now since I’m WFH. The puppy is about 3 months old and at around 2 months, she started throwing up. I took her to the emergency vet and found out she had an obstruction in her intestines. This meant she had to have surgery and her insurance hasn’t kicked in so I had to pay out of pocket. I had to take out a credit card to pay the 7K bill. She came home and was doing really well. Then 2 days ago she started throwing up again. She threw up around 6 times. I took her back to the vet and they had to run a bunch of tests again (another 1K) and it seems like a treat I gave her may have irritated her intestines again. They wanted to do more tests but I literally can not afford it. I spoke to the vet about it as none of this can be covered by insurance. The vet gave her an anti nausea medication and sent us home to observe her. She ate and hasn’t vomited but I’m still nervous about it all. I really got the dog in hopes that it would also help with my depression but it’s becoming worse due to all of this…I feel helpless and I can’t afford to take her back to the vet…",No one to talk to,0

"Hi all, I thought this would be a good place to ask.

Sometimes its best for my stress and anxiety to flat out block apps and websites that cause me stress. I have a very bad habit of wanting to dig things up from the past, even if they would hurt me, and often times the best way for me to combat this is to restrict myself from accessing social media.

Right now I've been using an app called 'Freedom' which has been very useful. The issue? I've figured out how to disable it whenever I want. Knowing that at any point I could breach the restrictions I put in place just makes me super anxious. I'm able to go into the VPN settings and turn off 'connect on demand' which allows me to bypass the block.

Does anyone know any surefire way I can block things, and not have access to them? being able to set a block on social media for 24 hours is often the best way I can get back on track with my day, and stop stressing over digging up things that would hurt me.

" I (26F), am going through it tonight. Honestly? I couldn't tell if my post belonged in the anxiety or rant subreddit, but I asked myself aloud, ""How do I feel?"", and my answer was: stressed.

So, here I am. 

Crying and bawling my eyes out. 'Why?' you might ask. Well, I'll tell you a little bit about me...I am an overweight female who has gone through shit in my 26 years of living. My childhood was basically robbed of me, mainly because I witnessed fights and screaming matches between family members and a near divorce with the parentals. I was also bullied majority of my early childhood all the way through middle school. After all of this happened (and there was a lot more than that), I felt like I was forced to grow up and basically chose 'flight mode' to save myself.

What I mean by that is, closing myself off. Staying in my room and coming out when I absolutely have to. I have a fear of being rejected, and being a failure. I am afraid of being yelled at for doing something wrong and I have a fear of getting into trouble and being reprimanded.

I still live with my parents and I have no job because of just basically, being socially anxious. I stutter around people I don't know and that makes me even more anxious and self-conscious. I forget things easily and that in turn, furthers my fear of being incapable of a job. On top of that, I have trouble sleeping at night because thoughts run through my head a million times a second. Because of this, I wake up late almost everyday (at 11am).

Just tonight, my mom basically dumped a, 'we need to talk' case on me and already I felt my blood run cold. She's talking to me but all I hear is my heart thumping in my ears. She tells me I need to work on waking up early because the rest of the world wakes up early like ""adults"". I felt very offended by that and told her that it's not my fault that I can't sleep properly at night. I, in fact, tell this to her everyday, so it's not old news. Yet, when I did remind her of this, she basically sighed and almost wanted to roll her eyes. Then she tells me I need a week to just 'work on myself' to fix that and realistically, thats not how that works but I didn't say anything.

Then she tells me I need to find a job. Something that pays and that 70% of the world gets up and does a 9 to 5 job which I already knew. Now, I was starting think she thinks I'm lazy or something when it's absolutely not the case.

Truth is, I have been getting together with my younger sister who is an artist on doing freelance stuff that we are both interested in doing. We have been talking about it little by little. I told my mom this and she didn't seem to believe me, basically looking at me with an expression of, ""Ohhh really like what"".

So she asks, ""Okay, what have y'all worked on today?"" of all things she asks on the day me and my younger sister decide to take at least the day off from planning. I said, ""Well, we are taking a break today but I designed some stuff for xx and sended it to her and she reformatted and polished it up."" my mom seemed to deflate in a way that said, 'That was it?' 

Not gonna lie, it made me feel bad and then she went into a repeated 5 minute lecture on how we need to wake up earlier and start the day like adults. Meanwhile I'm here depressed, stressed and just over it at this point. Over the fact that she just doesn't understand at all. She says, 'I know you can do it. I know that.'

But does she really? Anytime I do, 'do it', she seemes to be unsatisfied and that pushes me a million steps back. 

I get upset and after we finish talking, I go to my room to sleep (11pm at this point) and I just start bawling at how useless I felt and the whole, 'why is my life like this'.

It took so much in me not to burst into tears in front of her but man my throat was tighrening so bad it hurt that I couldn't speak for a good few seconds.

I don't know, I guess I just need some advice on the situation? Anytime I'm in this position my stress literally goes through the roof and I don't know how to manage it (like the need to runaway, disappear or worse). I really do want to work, I want to recieve a paycheck and get my own place and my own car and things, but why am I always on flight mode all the time?",My mind &amp; body choses flight instead of fight.,0

"TL;DR: Can't sleep due to stress.

Whenever I become stressed I either don't sleep or keep on waking up every hour roughly for a good while and then ultimately wake up in the morning absolutely exhausted.

"I know stress can cause a lack of appetite, but can it cause hunger signals to disappear entirely?

I have been dealing with an extremely stressful situation lately (on a waiting list for therapy atm). The stress has been making me feel I’ll (mostly low energy, sore/achy, headaches and stomach pain). 

I’m used to losing my appetite when stressed or grieving, but with this situation I haven’t even been feeling hungry. Like, I’ll go straight from fine to “my stomach hurts and is growling from being empty” with no warning. At the point when my stomach starts hurting, I force myself to eat something but it is difficult since my appetite is gone so nothing sounds good and it seems counterintuitive to eat when I feel nauseous. When I am able to eat, it is much less than I normally would.

"I'm already spread thin and stressed to the max.  My husband is out of town for two weeks for family reasons and I feel overwhelmed with everything. We also haven't been apart for more than a few days in 9 years.

The last few says have been especially rough. I've been having to drive home in the middle of the day to let our dog out and and give her meds. We have opposite schedules so he usually does those things before he goes to work. I don't always find parking again when I get back from taking care of her either. We adopted another dog right before he left too which I was hesitant to do. In just 3 days he's already needed to go to the vet twice. Once to look at his neuter incision and again later this week for what appears to be allergies or a virus. We have another dog who's been with us since before we got married. She's undergoing chemo treatment but is doing well. I worry about her catching something if he's sick. I've been sleeping on the couch the past few nights to keep him apart from her because she sleeps in our bedroom and he doesn't need to be jumping on the bed. He also wakes himself and me up multiple times a night because of his stuffy nose. On top of all that, I ran over a bunch of nails in the road and of course one got into my tire. I'm also struggling with school right now.

I'm stressed and frustrated all around. My husband left to his dad's home country to bury him and spend two weeks with his family there. I'm glad he was able to go, but I feel bad that part of me is upset with him about leaving this long. I took on all the responsibilities we share plus extra so he could go. He hasn't even been gone a week yet. I don't know how I'm going to keep everything up until he gets back. My stress management techniques are poor. Other than sleeping, there's nothing that helps me alleviate stress.",Everything has fallen on me and I'm stressed out,0
"I'm an highly stressed person and when i have a hard week, i tend to 
1. Tell myself i'm not good enough and that I should do things quicker
2. Drink at least once in à week
3. Do unhealthy behavior when drunk then regretting it 

I'm drinking enough to lose sight of space and time for two hours.

I'm healthy, i'm only eating meals that I Cook with non transformated ingredients and i'm fit (i run and i go to the gym 3 times à week). I love school and what i do, but there's a lot of pressure because we have classes even on saturday.

I can't really talk to anyone about this. I tried méditation for a month, but while i was on vacation so it was easier. And i won't talk about it to my family because when i had anxiety attack :
- my dad didn't take me seriously and said i was à crybaby and i was overly dramatic
- my mother has zero reaction or find à way to talk about herself to say in à more subtile way i'm à crybaby and that she had it harder than me.

"I hope I'm not on the wrong subreddit for this question.

Kind of talking about like the quote, 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger' or something like that.

I'm not sure, but I feel like I don't cope with stress too well. I can manage to study for long hours without tears or anything, but that is in the past. I feel like these days I'm feeling the pressure. 

I have a feeling that if I fail a question or something like that I just start to contemplate my life even after the exam. Even like I would get on the verge of tears if I didn't know something. Like if I fail the exam, I don't have good grades, then I don't go to a good university, then I don't get a job or either I get a job with little pay, people make fun of me, etc.

Honestly makes me feel anxious, but even if I have coping techniques sometimes I still really wish I could just put myself into extremely stressful environments. But not like life-threatening events, I just want to put myself under immense, crippling stress when I do everyday basic things (like practicing an exam paper, or cleaning within a time limit). 

Sometimes I feel that its necessary for me to just stress myself out 24/7, then after that I'll develop a good stress tolerance or something like that. I just really wished I were one of those people who are extremely good at managing stress, and never shed a tear in a very long time (and I mean, years).

To be honest, I know its sounds like I'm really self-sabotaging, but no matter how much I really want to pressure myself to the extremes, I have a feeling it probably isn't right for me. But then again, there's people around me (especially on the internet) who study for hours, or work for many hours, and probably do well under pressure.

Just hope someone would answer this question for me.","Is it shown that being exposed to extreme stress levels frequently, builds higher stress tolerance levels?",0

"Hello :) 

I've made a little relaxation video, which might help you to find a little calm in the midst of chaos. 

It's actually based on Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) which is a scientifically based and easy-to-learn deep relaxation technique.  In the video we will briefly tense one muscle group after another, followed by a relaxation phase.  The interaction between physical and mental tension and thus relaxation is the focus and should help you find the relaxation you are looking for.

I hope it helps you :) All the best

"So these past few weeks I’ve pretty much lost control over my emotions. I’m in a constant state of confusion and stress but I also feel like a zombie. 

My job is the main source of this. It’s hard to explain but I’ll give it a go. This is a temporary job that was supposed to last from March 2021-September 2021, but it has gotten extended multiple times and now our end date is set for February 2022. I work for a company that is contracted through to state to do Covid vaccinations. Our team does only mobile clinics and I am in charge of logistics. This means I am in charge of the vaccine storage, supplies storage, supply packing, supply chain, receiving vaccine shipments, keeping inventory and such. I am the only person who does this job at our location. I am required to get each team ready and pack supplies and vaccine before the clinic and to return everything once the teams return. This schedule has been ruining my sleep. For instance, Wednesday I will finish work at 9:30pm. I will be back at work Thursday at 5:30am, but I won’t be done with work until 10pm, all to be back at work again at 5am Friday morning. I’m working 6 days a week, not getting more than 5 hours of sleep on the average. 

Oh and I’m getting married in less than 3 weeks. I’m constantly forgetting things, my performance at work is struggling and my mental state is awful. I tried to get out of a moving car on the highway the other night. I’ve cried everyday the past week. I’m angry, irrational and miserable. I’m barely eating, I’m averaging 10000 steps a day and still gaining weight. My family and my partner have begged me to take a day off. But if I take a day off it won’t actually be a day off. Nobody else knows how to do my job in total. Whenever I’ve taken off before it always means more stress when I return, or they’ll just contact me while I’m off, because they don’t know what to do especially if it’s an unplanned absence.

"Im in a city where most of my family resides, but I’m homeless because i’d rather be alone than be around negative people. 

It’s been a few months since i chose this path and I’ve been strong the entire way through it, until now.

Just got out of a short relationship that was bit toxic for my taste. She was basing our relationship off of shall we say, physical aspects.

I just found out on top of that, she was fucking her ex while we’ve been talking and just yesterday she told me that she believes she may be pregnant by her ex, but it’s too early to take a pregnancy test.

So, I acted normal let the conversation flow as it would over the phone until we finished and, I could not stop thinking about what she had just told me.

Next day i told her we should brake up, we did. She blamed everything on me. I kept my cool, explained how i felt. I was ignored.

So, i created distance so i could heal.


But i’ve come to the conclusion that i don’t want to heal, i just want this to end. Ive never been more ready to end my life until today, not because of the break up, but because of everything.

"Hey, joined this community just now since I kinda need some life advice, from anyone.

I've always been stressing out a lot over various things, but as of recently I started to realise that it has taken over my life in various ways. 

For example, even as of recently I was supposed to drive a group of friends to a theme park. Just a fun day, but the responsibility of driving my friends there somehow made me insanely nervous, even though I was ""calm inside"" if that makes sense. As a result I slept 0 hours in total. Melatonin didn't work, meditating did nothing, breathing exercises did nothing, my mind just kept on racing.  
(p.s. a friend drove in my car for me, I'm not driving on 0 hrs of sleep)

  
It's not just that single event though. School days cause stress, tests cause stress, even having a totally free day but having to receive a package the next day causes sleep issues and stomach aches.   
When doing things I'm always thinking about the worst thing that could happen, and what if that would happen, even if the chances are minimal, which only adds up to the stress.  
Idk anymore, should I visit a psychiatrist? Like what do you do here? This has been ongoing for at least 10 years now, I'm currently 22 and this has to stop

"The more weeks go by, the more helpless I feel about this course. I hate the professor, I hate the lab partners, I hate the TAs, I hate the activities and homework we have to do and I hate physics the most.

I never had a sturdy foundation in physics anyways. The only reason i managed with physics in high school was because I memorized most of the solutions and most of the problems were similar to the other problems I practiced. Besides, my tutor was good at helping me learn. 

I'm doing an introductory physics course this semester, and I feel so absolutely dumb. We're supposed to work in groups to complete activities and every week we are given a set of problems for homework. The professor adds a set of puzzles at the end of every assignment to supposedly promote logical thinking and spatial reasoning or whatever.

The thing is I never really liked physics in the first place, but not I hate it. The labs are for two hours, I can't understand a single concept and the people in my group are so snide and rude about the fact that they understand the class and I can't. I remember asking for help about a homework problem to them on Discord, and I would have been grateful if they had given me a few hints about how they solved that problem, but all they did was send the wrong answers and made a bunch of memes about how they trolled me. One of the guys is so arrogant about how he took AP Physics and he knows all of the concepts and is so good at physics.

Meanwhile I can't even do a single problem independently. The professor also gives a bunch of puzzles like kenkens or spatial reasoning problems that I'm too dumb to do and I'm doing the worst in that class. It's just too much for me. 

Aside from that course, I'm in computer science and while my other classes aren't as awful, they're also pretty difficult. Plus, I have work study, and most of my work hours coincide with the office hours. I still have to take the course as a requirement and I feel like I'm going to fail.

He’s very upset over his situation and feels like I don’t understand which of course I do not understand it completely but I have a different set of stressors related to this situation. The problem is that our lives had a lot of stress prior to his injury so it’s just too much. I try not to let on how stressed I am because he obviously is in a worse state that me. He won’t talk about things much and when I try to help him he says I’m making it worse and smothering him.

"i'm a 18 (F) freshmen in college, I have been going to this library on campus for the past few days there has been this recurring guy (im assuming 18/19)  that I have seen every time (we have never spoken but have made a lot of eye contact) I have been there. there have been some time where the library was packed and I had to sit at the same table as him and vice versa today I was sitting alone at this table that me and him have sat at together a few times and he came over and sat at this table with one of his friends. 

Eventually one of my friends showed up and soon after his friend left (this left,  me, my friend and him at a table that seats 4 people) soon after one of my other friends showed up so all the stats at the table where filled. we where all just working quietly for around an hour. after that hour he later  left and my friends left soon after. I spent another hour there by myself finishing up some work 

I am a big glancer I look around a lot whenever I am doing something so this has caused me and this boy to make a lot of eye contact. when I was taking a break from my work I saw him coming back into the building me and him made eye contact and he quickly walked away this was a bit of a surprise because he usually sits down 

I assumed that he either wanted the table for himself or he had some friends coming and needed a bigger table. so I moved seats I got up and went to a single table. I went to go fill up my water bottle after I placed my stuff down at the new table, when I was walking back to my new table I made eye contact with him again because he was walking the same direction. 

I sat down at my new table and put my AirPods in assuming that he moved to the table that sat 4 people, out of the corner of my eye I saw him walk up to my table. I took my AirPods out and he asked me ""hey, you didn't move seats because of me right?"" with ought even thinking I just quickly shook my head and said  ""oh no!"" before I could say anything else he said ""ok I was just making sure, have a nice day"" and he walked away.

I see a physio, a TMD specialist, a psychiatrist, a therapist, I’ve tried somatic experiencing therapy, emdr, tre - I’m exhausted honestly. I journal, I read, I meditate, I cry, I dance, I walk, I get out in nature - all things I do naturally, not forced but that should help.

I just don’t know how to break the cycle. I have no hope left. The only times in the last three years where I’ve felt the most like myself was during lockdowns.

"I’ve been posting my journey for the last 2 years as these symptoms came on abruptly and to this day have never left.

Absolutely nothing resolves this completely ever however I notice when I don’t focus on them and I’m occupied I don’t really necessarily notice the symptoms. If I’m not occupied the symptoms feel much more apparent and worse. 

I did use Klonapin for a year so maybe the dry eye or some of these shakes are side effects of stopping that a few months ago but the head pressure existed even before I started the Klonapin. 

Does anyone have the same or similar symptoms? I feel it’s ridiculous to just have to live with this and I’ve read enough that there’s a ton of people experiencing this so maybe we can all share what helps to resolve this altogether. Thanks guys","Head pressure, dry eye &amp; anxiety",0

"It's hard to explain, I'm guessing its some sort of stress, but I can't figure out how to get over it.  A little background.  Before the beginning of Covid Lockdowns (like right before) I had a major breakdown and went into severe depression.  My sister was about to go through a life saving organ transplant (which went well), I had someone break up with me, I had 2 major career defining projects I was leading that weren't going well, and I was suffering from a torn labrum which stopped me from doing a hobby I loved.  All of this happening in the span of about a week.

It took me a long time to get out of my depression.  I took medication, stopped worrying as much about having a great career, learned meditation and practiced it daily, found a new hobby, and tried enjoying life more over the span of the pandemic.  I decided to make it a point to get away from my previous job as it caused me a major amount of stress.  They overworked me, and the pay wasn't great for the amount of responsibilities put on my shoulders.

It took me nearly 1.5 years to finally land a new job and leave that job behind.  I have fantastic bosses at my new job, they pay me well and make sure that I'm compensated for my overtime whenever that is necessary (which isn't often).  The only complaint I have about my job is it's a bit boring and not very challenging (or at least it shouldn't be).

Now here's my major problem.  I'm falling behind on my work and not learning at the speed I use to when starting a new job.  I'm having difficulties learning all the systems and parts even though most of my job is just surveying equipment, and designing simple parts and cable assemblies.

Every time I start on a new task or job, I start experiencing a dull stress and what I think is ""brain fog"".  It feels like the top of my brain just hardens, and I get a mild headache.  Over the day it drains me, but once I get off work I start quickly recovering.

I use to thrive doing challenging work and continually learning new things in my field.  Now I just feel tired all the time.  I'm tired of feeling like this.  I've asked for more challenging tasks from my boss and I get them, but it doesn't help.

I just want to feel unburdened again at work.",Stress when working,0

"**STRESS..…STRESS…STRESS…STRESS…STRESS…..STRESSED!**

**Why do you think in this 21st century, from a child going to preschool to a retired person experiencing stress?**

*DID YOU KNOW?* As per the world health organization, 1 in every 5 persons (20% of the population) in India are said to be suffering from some form of mental unrest.

The world is running towards success and accomplishment. During this; we compromise on our health, sleep, food, relationships, and ultimately ourselves. Stressors are increasing which in turn results in stress!

YOU MAY ASK, WHAT DOES STRESS DO TO ME???

Well, do you have headaches, upset stomach, chest pain, loss of sleep, and high BP? Then, you have stress! Stress can increase your chances of having a heart attack by 25%, heart diseases by 40%, and stroke by 50%. Stress can lead to memory problems, inability to concentrate, poor judgment, negative thoughts, inability to relax, general unhappiness, and a sense of loneliness. Below are given some ways you can overcome your stress.

**EASY TIPS TO MANAGE STRESS**

Every individual has their own style of dealing with stress. However, there are basic guidelines for dealing with stress. Here they are-

* **Reframe** the stressor to see a whole new picture.

During a stressful situation explain the situation on a lighter note to yourself. Remind yourself to see life as continuous learning. Look at the positive side!

* Failure is a stepping stone to success.
* You failed so what? Get over it.
* There is no such thing as failure, only feedback.  

* **Journal writing is a voyage to the interior.**

Maintain a stress journal. Identify the regular stressors in your life and the way you deal with them. Each time you feel stressed, keep track of it in your journal as you keep a daily log, you will begin to see patterns and common themes.

Write down-

* What caused your stress (make a guess if unsure)
* How you felt, both physically and emotionally
* How you acted in response
* What you did to make yourself feel better.
* **Test your thoughts.**

When something stressful happens. Assess what the outcome of the situation like its irrelevance, positivity, accuracy and the truth behind it. Like what am I think? Is it true? Could there be another way to look at this situation?.

* **Manage your time**. Stress is managed by simply planning your day well in advance. Like maintaining a weekly planner with all the deadlines, meetings, appointments, family time and most importantly don’t forget to throw some ‘**me time’** in there too.
* You **can’t control everything**.

Learn to let go of things over which you don’t have a control. Without forgiveness, we experience stress in a more raw, unblocked way. When in a distressing situation, pause, take slow deep breaths and tell yourself ‘**it’s okay’ I can move on.**

* **Count your blessings.** A powerful **antidote to** [**stress.**](http://www.cadabamshospitals.com/)

Learn to be grateful for what you have even if you feel it’s not enough. Tell yourself, I am strong and I will put my 100%.

* **Take time to relax**. **Ten minutes of quiet meditation** a day is powerful medicine. You can pray, listen to relaxing music or just simply focus on your breathing. Guided imagery, clinical [**hypnosis**](https://www.psychologytoday.com/therapy-types/hypnotherapy), and biofeedback are all useful for managing stress.

If none of the above works for you, then it is a good idea you get diagnosed with a good psychologist who can best help you in giving the right treatment for managing your stress.",Managing Stress,0
"Does anybody else cry as a stress response after a period of stress or anxiety? I find that often happens to me when I'm alone or in a dark place - literally. 

For example, I just came back from the cinema with my mother, and while watching the movie in a dark and safe place, the tears just started flowing, probably releasing all the built up tension from the last week.

Problem is, that Mum noticed this and thinks there's something wrong with me now and ended up telling me to get over whatever I'm thinking about, but I'm fine. She doesn't understand that it's just a way my body gets rid of all the extra pressure and tension.

"5 days from today, my life is about to change. While this may or will be a good move for me, I am majorly stressed out due to this change.  Some background, over a year ago, the company that I currently work for, announced that they will be laying off staff at my location and moving operations back to a HUGE city that I personally didn’t want to move back to, so I chose to take my 21 years of service severance package and will be moving further west to the coast. This past year has had issues nonetheless, due to the company stalling our end of work date consistently, which was due to supply chain issues from the Pandemic, which the company didn’t foresee when they announced the layoff and/or work transfer notice. This “stall” has caused a lot of stress on myself and my co-workers with not knowing when we’d all be getting the axe. The company had us all dangling from one meeting to another, when finally, at the end of last May, they announced that our end of work date will be at the end of this August. During this year long “wait” with not knowing when our actual end date would be, the lady whom I rented my basement room from, took it upon herself and just “guessed” that my end of work date would be sometime last May, and basically evicted me out of the basement, however she offered me to stay in another room in the house. She did this so she could get more money from a family of three who moved into the basement last May from the UK. This was an annoyance, however I do get on very well with the family, who are really cool people. I did a massive purge and downsized a lot of my belongings, which what is left,  fits snuggley into my vehicle. I can’t afford to hire a moving truck or get a hitch put on my car and pay for a uhaul trailer…so minimizing was the way to go. With finally knowing my actual end date, I could now start prepping for my move further west to the coast. I applied for school, got in and start in September. My finances are “f’k’d” to say the least, I have had to sink ALOT of money into getting my vehicle road trip ready, and due to this, has left me very short on cash with funding this road trip/move. I needed to get a “temp” place which allows dogs, where the college is,  and seeing how I don’t know a soul in and around that area, I opted to book an air bnb for the moth of September and 1st week of October. This air bnb is pretty pricey. However, I felt I have no choice but to go there and start looking for a dog friendly place when I get there. I applied for another credit card but was denied due to a “fraud alert” on my credit report from 4 years ago when I got my vehicle broken into and my purse was stolen. I went and got and paid for the police record, supplied my passport and driver’s license as photo I.d, and got copies of them all and gave it to the bank where I applied for the credit cards over a week ago. The bank lady sent these copies to the department that issues credit cards, but they didn’t read her “notes” and see the attached files.  😑 the Airbnb payment is due this Thursday, and I was starting to panic. I asked a family member to help me out to no shagrin. 😑 luckily, a very good friend of mine has loaned me the money, knowing I will be getting a HUGE severance payout in mid September. thank god. *whew!* still waiting on my own bank to transfer this Airbnb money to my large credit card, so I can pay the Airbnb. I am hoping that happens today or tomorrow. I got a finally fix done on my vehicle yesterday, and while driving I noticed a strange noise, so I will have to go back there to have it looked at.

"First off, I have PTSD from being in the military. I overreact to stressors in my environment significantly. So I am totally aware of having higher stress levels than the average person. But what I do not understand is why my muscles stay tense 24/7.

I mainly feel this in my neck/jaw/shoulders area. I literally (and not saying this like ""omg I literally died the other day when...but as in the way the term is actually meant for) feel like I cannot let my head relax into my pillow at night. It's like my body refuses to allow the pillow to take the weight of my head. I can consciously think, ""ok, I'm gonna relax my neck now and let my head fall deep into this pillow,"" and it works...for a few fleeting moments until I stop actively thinking about it. Seconds later I will realize that my shoulders are up to my ears again, and my neck is no longer relaxing. 

I keep my jaw tense all the time as well. So much so that I have so many chipped teeth that my dentist has stopped fixing them until they get really bad. I have a bite guard for sleeping, but I think the damage is also done during the day. I asked my wife the other day which was ""normal"" for her: when not thinking about it, do your top and bottom teeth stay closed/touching each other, or is there a small gap? She went with the small gap, and I can see that my body wants that to be my normal too, but it is not. My teeth stay chomped down onto each other, nearly 24/7. I'd bet my neck and teeth stay tense even when I am asleep. 

I absolutely hate this. I can never get comfortable. I cannot sleep well. I look like a 10 year old with ADHD because I'm constantly wiggling around while seated in order to get some sort of comfort here and there. And all this misery boils down to the tension in these 3 areas. 

Anyone have any suggestions for this? I've told my Dr many times at the VA about this, and I have muscle relaxers, but rarely take them because they make me super sleepy during the day, and if I take them at night, I feel kinda hung over the next morning. So I only take them when in absolute discomfort. 

I go to a chiropractor 2x a week. I go to physical therapy for shoulder issues 2x a week. I regularly use a foam roller and a Chirp wheel, almost daily, several times a day. I even started yoga this week...but I've only been once so far. 

Oh, and I get a massage 2x a month, by a massage therapist at the chiropractor, who can target areas of concern from my chiropractic file. So not a feel good massage, but one that works on working knots out and loosening ligaments (not sure if I am using the right terminology there). Last week, after several months, she was able to finally ""get in"" my upper traps and for a few amazing, godly seconds, I actually felt true neck relaxation. It was so wonderful....and so sad when it quickly went back to my normal. But that fleeting glimpse of bliss told me that it is possible to find relief. 

So I have finally turned to Reddit to ask for help.",I can never relax my neck/shoulders/jaw...any tips?,0

Got discharged at the begging of the year before starting college, had to get back at it again after starting the course. I took the same meds as before which I used for years, but my body didn't understand that I have already took then before and had some side effects that scared me and I stopped taking one of the meds. Then after the end of my 1st semester I was looking worse with my depression, so my psychiatrist decided to give me adult depression meds... safe to say it backfire extraordinarily, I just turned 18, barely a month ago. 

Went to other doctors and and the 1st side effect went away, but the adult medication gave me more and worse side effects, so again me psychiatrist suggested changing meds. My mom already had some bad impressions on the doctor so after they tried to change again with no wait to see if I'd get better, she told me to stop taking any meds altogether.

I get why, my appetite is lower than usual and I am super sensible to climate and temperature, my intestines are hurting and my head aches everyday. So I am currently on the process of adapting. And a new college period stared when I was told to change meds for the 2nd time... I am barely keeping up again with whats being teached and although I got the handle of how college works, I am suffering. Stuff that usually don't bother me or gove me so much work are really demanding me. I am not taking notes as I'd like or being able to concentrate in almost any task that is mildly difficult. Am currently procrastinating the 36 pages and topics that range from a to z of architecture topics that I have to summarise and another 17 pages that I also will summarise, all for today untill 11:59 PM, currently the hour is 19:07...",How do I get better?,0
"Hello Guys, We’ve haven’t seen anything related to binaural beats here, so I thought of sharing something that might be useful to you guys, because it helped me a ton. Binaural beats are claimed to induce various same mental states associated like reduce anxiety, relieve stress while increasing relaxation, increase focus and concentration, promote creativity, dreaming etc. In essence a binaural beat is an acoustic stereo signal, typically a sine wave, from which the left channel is slightly detuned to the right channel. This difference, measured in Hz, produces a waving motion that is actually audible when listened to on stereo headphones. This difference dictates the speed of the binaural beat which has different effects on your brain. Each frequency is associated with outcomes that correspond to different levels of brain wave activity. Here is a little guide on the most important frequency ranges:  


* Gamma waves: Between 30 Hz and 50 Hz, linked to higher alertness, concentration, and improved problem solving, learning, memory and mood.
* Beta waves: between 13 Hz and 30 Hz, similar to Gamma, linked to an active and alert mind,  improves mood and task performance
* Alpha waves: between 8 Hz and 13 Hz, indicate a relaxed and restful mind, can increase creativity
* Theta waves: between 4 Hz and 8 Hz, associated with drowsiness and meditation, reduced anxiety, relaxation
* Delta waves: between 0.5 Hz and 4 Hz, relaxation, deep sleep, dreaming

There is a lot of stuff on youtube you can check out and listen to. I mostly listen to binaural beats in the beta range for sleeping, meditation and lucid dreaming. After 10 minutes you really feel like your are sinking deeper in your mind. These beats are often accompanies by music playing on top of them, which is sometimes really nice, but we have a created a some natural ambiences that feature binaural beats.  If you want to check out our channel, you can do so here. We’d love to get feedback on those as well. :)

"I start my first year of college and I’m super stressed out and even though I’ve been taking College classes through my high school, I’m still stressed out about it. I’ve been stressed about school my whole life despite having all As and being in the top 10% of my grade. I really don’t understand how people can just have a calm attitude when it comes to things like school and work because the mere thought of either stresses me out. Now usually after the first month, I’m completely fine because I’ve gotten used to the class, the teacher, and the work but the first couple weeks are so stressful for me. I have a mad fear of being alone and failure and I like things to always stay the same in my life so I guess all of that contributes to my problems with stressful situations. I have no friends going to the same college as me and I’ve always liked having at least one person I knew to make me more comfortable quicker but having work thrown in front of me and having to one to talk to if I need help is terrifying to me. Sorry about the rambling but I would like some advice if anyone would be nice enough to give it.",Does anyone else get stressed out over School even though they’ve been doing it their whole lives?,0

Sorry for posting so much, but i Feel like my actual soul and presence is gone from my body. Like literally just burned away. 

I Feel i have emotional numbness, like actual numbness. I have emotions mentally some times, but my body and brain is like physically numb so i cant Feel them. 

I Sometimes get hints of emotions in my body, but it is also distant and numb. And i cant Feel it.

My body is just a body, and i am just a mental voice. There is no presence or life anymore. 

I have no emotion or feeling of anything. 

All feelings left, and the last to go was the feeling of myself. 

Music and food and the sun and my Friends. All gone and no feeling. How can i Feel music if i cant even Feel myself. 

No desires, or motivation or sadness or love. Just nothingness. 

I had a physical feeling that my brain was empty, like a physical feeling of a room inside my head, like my brain
Like you can physically Feel your brain is empty. This feeling is also gone. I cant Feel my brain.

Mine went away, and now i dont have much in my head of thougts emotions and feelings.

My memory is complete crap. 

I live life in this strange 2D without any feeling or emotion.

"Have you ever come across situations in life when annoyance and irritability overpowered your fragile Mental Health?

Maybe you had a bad day in the office where the boss irritated you, your team member shies away from his responsibility and you feel overwhelmed and fully out of control?

These small issues and many more like these can rob your inner peace and happiness. So, now what can you do to restore your mental health and feel in tune with yourself?

You can learn to control your emotional responses through a self-help training skill known as **Emotional Mastery**.

**What Exactly Is Emotional Mastery?**

Emotional mastery means being in a state of awareness and acceptance of the way you feel. It refers to a gradual and slow process of controlling and conquering negative emotions that slowly leads to feelings of being overwhelmed and jittery.

In this process, you will not allow your feelings to overpower you. Being in control of your emotions cannot happen suddenly.

It is a process of identifying, controlling, and using your overwhelming feelings in positive ways to develop good relationships and effective communication with others.

Emotional mastery helps in diffusing conflict. It gives you inner peace and happiness like never before. The process helps to reduce everyday stress as you are no longer the victim of your overwhelming feelings.

**5 Techniques of Emotional Mastery**

These techniques are actionable ways that you can incorporate into your daily life to triumph over your negative emotions.

1. Identify your feelings and let them flow in and out as it is. Acceptance is the first step towards mastery.

2. Appreciate and embrace your emotions as a part of you. Without emotions, your life is meaningless. They are the flavor and color that define your existence.

3. Approach your emotions with a sense of curiosity. Try to pay attention to what these emotions are telling you. Acknowledge your feelings whether good or bad as authentic and meaningful.

4. The most powerful way to master emotions is by remembering a previous situation where you have handled a difficult emotional surge in a healthy way. By this, you gain the confidence of handling similar situations successfully now and in the future as well.

5. Celebrate your small success stories where you have controlled your annoyance, anger, and fear in a healthy way without getting overwhelmed. In doing so, you gather more courage and confidence to master emotions in troubling times as well.

**To Sum Up**

Emotions are an integral part of being human. Thus, cultivating emotional mastery helps to use your feelings in healthy ways so that life becomes all the more beautiful. You should not allow emotions to use you. This life skill is an essential ingredient for achieving your dreams and goals.

"Stress management is new to me. I have several diagnoses and am being treated by a psychiatrist and a therapist. I've been on short term disability for 3 months now due to migraine complications. After several images and tests, the neurologist sums my condition up to excessive environmental stresses which brought on medical predispositions such as occipital neuralgia with chronic migraine disorder. I also recently stopped drinking alcohol.

I've been on bed rest for the past few months, and after a recent procedure to prevent migraines, my neurologist has cleared me to return to work in 2 weeks. 

I won't bore anyone with the details of my stresses these past months, but at 44 I can truly say this is the most stress I've experienced in my life, to the point that my body gave up. I need a good program on how to manage my stress if I'm going to be able to live my life.

So I'm reaching out here, asking if anyone has found a good program and wouldn't mind sharing it. I'm also going to AA meetings and am in the early stages of that 12 step program. Thanks.",Stress Management,0
" Often times stress will manifest when we carry over yesterdays concerns into our present day concerns. An accumulation will almost always end up in a high stress level. Therefore, we must be able to dump all of our concerns from the previous day or days and concentrate  wholly on our today.  If you are having trouble sleeping, there are a few steps you can take to help your body naturally get to sleep. First try to get to bed at the same time every night your body runs on an internal clock and if you don't get to sleep every night at the same time you can through that clock out of whack so a regular bedtime routine is good practice even if you aren't tired try to lay down maybe read a book or listen to some relaxing music. Lifestyle choices will affect your sleep as well such as smoking, illicit drug use and pharmaceuticals, alcohol and caffeine; try to limit your intake of such things for better sleep. Next in line is nutrition, a combination of herbs and vitamins can help naturally relax the body and mind to help one get better sleep all night long. Green tea is an herb that is loaded with the amino acid l-Theanine, studies have shown l-Theanine to can help calm the brain, given todays high pass lifestyles most of us are still thinking about work or what needs to go on your grocery list while laying in bed, l-Theanine helps calm your thoughts for a better nights sleep.

I want to Feel, but there is nothing in my body. When i am sad and angry i just know, because there is nothing in my body. No surge of rage and no pain in my chest. 

When i lay down under my covers, i dont get a familiar calm and warm, heavy feeling in my body. It is still hard as stone on the inside.

Also i dont Feel hunger. And never sleepy in my head. I also dont Feel confused in my head or get a foggy feeling. Even though i know that is what i am. 

I also never get a feeling associated with a place or memory. When i think of a memory i get no spontanious emotion connected to it. 

Like sitting on the terrace with a nice cup of tee, early morning walks, sitting down on the couch after a hard day of work. Never get these feelings in my body. Also the feelifn of autimn, friday, christmas. All gone. Cant even remember them in my mind because i cant Feel with my brain. 

All emotions are purely mental. Sometimes my brain is so numb though it does not respond to any stimulus. And i have this constant unsatisfactory feeling because nothing makes me Feel.

"I thought I need to ""hustle my way to success"" but what I learned next changed my life forever…

The ""hustle culture"" is pretty toxic...

I was being told that working 10-12 hours a day, constantly chasing after the next task, and being totally drained afterwards, not even able to enjoy a dinner with my family is the way to success...

And believe me, I've done that for way too long.

After quitting my 9-5 job and deciding to start my first coaching business, I basically switched from working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week to 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.

""Finally quit the rat race!"", huh?

Quite frankly, it felt like less pressure than doing the typical 9-5 at the beginning because I was really excited to work on my dream.

As the months passed, I was getting deeper and deeper into the grind. 

It got to a point where I would wake up at 9:00 am, already thinking about work, then work through the whole day, and still be replying to my clients' messages at 1:30 am, lying in bed with my girlfriend.

My mind was constantly there - at work. 

At the dinner table, during a walk with my partner, even when skiing on vacation that I rarely took back then...

I was constantly experiencing this weird sense of guilt when I wasn't productive, and even though my business was growing, so was my anxiety, stress, and lack of satisfaction with life.

It eventually led to me getting sick so badly, that it was a struggle to even reply to a client's message. 

I was stressed out of my mind.

It felt like everything is going to collapse on me if I keep going down that route.

Finally, I decided to take a real break. 

I took a full 7 days off and decided to delete all the apps like Slack, Messenger and Gmail from my phone, which sounded absolutely crazy to me back then.

But man, it felt liberating.

Something clicked inside me, and finally, I was able to let go of all the pressure and stress that were haunting me.

For the first time in months, I experienced this deep sense of relief and inner peace.

By stepping out of this craziness, I was able to notice how toxic and unhealthy it was. 

How having healthy boundaries and balance in your life is key to actually enjoying what you're doing and what you're working so hard for.

Now, I truly believe that me getting crazy sick back then was one of the best things that could have happened to me.

It led to me finally re owning the enjoyment of my everyday life.

Plus, my business started rapidly growing as a result of me allocating my time more effectively and creating more value in less time.

It made me realize that much of ""the hustle"" I was doing was just me spinning my wheels on things that weren't really making the boat go faster.

Now, I know for sure that the best way to achieve better results is to master both the work and the relaxation.

To plan the life in such a way, that your wealth, health, and relationships are in perfect balance.

Please don’t waste your life thinking that there’s some pride in being over-stressed, overworked, and overwhelmed.","The ""hustle culture"" is pretty toxic...",0
"Hi there, so this playlist (available at both Apple Music and Spotify) came to life almost a year ago, when I'd finished researching the effects of listening to nature sounds.

Easily explained:You may have heard about our inherited fight-or-flight response system, which is a major factor in stress and anxiety. Well, research has shown that listening to nature sounds triggers the opposite system, called rest-or-digest, which helps lowering your heart rate, ease tightening muscles and enable you to focus on fewer things. These system is, just like our f-o-f response, is inherited from our ancestors. We believe that reason behind nature sounds triggering this is that hearing birds, rain etc meant positive things for the caveman generations. Birds singing meant that there were no large predators around (as well as good soil), rain meant crops would grow, fire that they would survive the night and so on.

Hope this helps everyone it reaches!

"For the last month I've been feeling fed up with my job and some of the people on my team. Every morning during meetings I fake being nice and wanting to talk with them, and the more they talk the angrier I've been getting lately. 

I've had mishaps happen and to me it seems like there is a lot of favoritism that happens in my work place. To keep that bit short, people that have left have said the same thing about the favoritism.

My anger with my job is also spilling into my personal life because I'm having dreams about these people now! I don't want to see a handful of them while I'm working and now they are in my dreams!

My personal life has been a hectic mess too, as I've made some huge life changes - for the better - but with the work B.S and the remodeling I'm doing (it's my parents' home that I'm staying in and working on) I have no fuse and blow up on just about everything.

I had an idea of the work that needed done and in the order, and my dad does the exact opposite of what I ask and tell him to do. Now all of a sudden I need to spend both more time and money on a project I asked him to start a month ago. 

The reason the remodel is pissing me off is cause it's not just me staying in the home now, my partner is too and even with the upstairs space done, it's not enough space. I've thrown things away and so has he in an attempt to make room and my dad seems to think there is all the time in the world to complete the work.

Has anyone had issues like this, where at work they feel wrongly treated and brood about it and the same goes for their personal life?

Everything is driving me bonkers cause I can't leave my job cause I desperately need the cash and I'm worried that if I went to another job it would be even worse! I've been looking at open jobs that I could do a good job in and a lot of places I've been interested in have complaints like the ones I have now. 

Rant over (phew!), but how can I manage all this stress and stop dreaming about work when I'm off the clock. And how can I deal with such a stubborn dad that is making me angry and burdening me and my partner. I would hate for my spoiled mood to ruin things between me and my boyfriend.",Stressed In and Out of Work,0

"Hi 27M, 185lbs, 5'11 here. The last two days I've been pretty stressed out with work and started noticing that to the left of my left eye little close to the side forehead I've been getting this awful pinching feeling that comes and goes. I drink some caffeine during the day, but today decided to lay off of it and it's still coming in waves. The best I can describe it as a pinching vain. I started worrying that it might be a stroke or aneurysm but quickly chalked that up to just being anxiety. I've been feeling a little ""foggy minded"" too so I wonder if that has come to play too? Yesterday night I drank a few beers and it seemed to help, but then came back when I was sober.

"Everyone wants less stress. And that is why in this post I will talk about daily habits for a less stressful life. I myself apply these habits every day in my life. So everything I talk about comes from my own experience. Once you apply the methods in this post regularly they will eventually become habits. At first it may be difficult to apply these methods because it may all feel a little strange. But once you experience the positive effects you will find enough motivation to continue.

WHY YOU NEED TO CREATE DAILY HABITS FOR A LESS STRESSFUL LIFE

Most people do a lot in a day. And that can be incredibly wonderful, but it can also cause a lot of stress. And stress is not always bad for you. It can sometimes help you get the best out of yourself. But long-term stress can be very bad for your health. For example, it can cause your immune system to deteriorate, making you more likely to get sick. But it can also cause you to become irritable and your mood to deteriorate. Ultimately, it can also cause you to have almost no energy or motivation left to do things. In addition to the aforementioned consequences of long-term stress, there are many more consequences that you don’t want to have either. And to reduce the risk of these consequences it can be helpful to create habits for a less stressful life.

FOCUS ON YOUR BREATHING FOR A LESS STRESSFUL LIFE

Sometimes people get a lot of stress because they get lost in thoughts. To prevent you from overthinking and getting stressed, it is useful to sometimes focus on your breathing. For example, if you are busy working or studying, remind yourself to focus on your breathing once every 10 minutes. You don’t have to breathe differently! Just let your breathing flow naturally but focus on it for a moment. Feel the air go in and out.

MEDITATION IS ONE OF THE DAILY HABITS FOR A LESS STRESSFUL LIFE

Meditation can help you unwind completely. You can meditate by sitting down and focusing on your breathing. As guidance you can say to yourself ¨in¨ when you inhale and ¨out¨ when you exhale. Then as your breathing gets deeper and slower you can say “deep” and “slow” to yourself. 

MAKE A DAILY HABIT OF GOING OUTSIDE FOR A LESS STRESSFUL LIFE.

The environment you are in can affect how much stress you experience. Suppose you are in an environment where you are constantly receiving signals that cause stress. Such as phone calls, emails, or other things that remind you of stressful situations. Then it can be useful to get away from this situation for a while. And preferably it can be useful to go to a park, forest, lake or sea. Because in these environments there is often a lot of space and there are few or no things that cause stress.

WALK MINDFULLY

And when you’re walking, pay attention to your footsteps and your breathing. Inhale and take, for example, three steps. And then when you exhale, take another three steps. Also feel how your feet touch the ground. This mindful way of walking gets you out of your head and into the moment.

GO EXERCISE AND FEEL THE STRESS DISAPPEAR

Being physically active is incredibly important. But it’s also incredibly helpful to exercise if you want to release stress. I myself really feel the stress disappear when I exercise. And if I’ve trained really hard I’m sometimes so tired that I don’t even feel like stressing about anything anymore haha. You don’t necessarily have to train super hard. The stress can also disappear during an easy workout. Or go for a jog while listening to your favorite music and feel the stress disappear.

HELP YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY

I wish you much success in applying these methods for a less stressful life. Hopefully you can apply them so often that they become habits in your daily life. But I do want to ask you one more thing. I suspect that you have friends and family who also sometimes suffer from long-term stress. You can help these friends and family by sending them this post. And maybe you can start creating these habits together which will make it a lot easier for both of you. Because working together on something ensures that you motivate each other.

"I've been undergoing a lot of stress as of late from some new developments in my life, and that has led me to lashing out at people, both friends and family, who are either trying to help or just engage in conversation.

"Some couples get pregnant easily while some do not despite trying for a long time. There could be multiple factors contributing to difficulty conceiving but of all of them, stress plays a significant role. Stress does not directly cause infertility however it does impact the chances of conception by delaying it. Infertility has become very common now and the factors contributing to it are multiple, ranging from physical causes, and dietary changes to even excessive use of gadgets. There is enough research to prove that stress can adversely affect a couple’s chances of conception naturally or through medical procedures like IVF. So, what is the relationship between stress and infertility?

## The science behind stress and infertility

When we are stressed, our brains release *cortisol*, a stress hormone that interferes with the signals between the brain and the ovaries, thus disrupting the ovarian cycle and the release of the ovarian eggs. In the case of men, sperm production and motility are impacted. Apart from the body’s response, stress contributes to behavior and mood changes too. There is a decrease in the desire and motivation to have sex. There is an increase in smoking or drinking alcohol in order to cope with stress which in turn causes trouble with conceiving.

## Understand the vicious cycle

Stress and conception are highly connected. Most often, couples who are trying to conceive become dejected when it takes a longer time. Some find the medical procedures involved in the process to be taxing. For example, most couples going through IVF procedures are often stressed out. This in turn affects the biology and behavior of the couple, thereby creating a vicious cycle. Stress management is thus necessary in order to break free from this cycle which in turn would help a couple conceive.

**Managing stress**

Some amount of stress is normal. However, if one is continuously anxious and hassled by circumstances around them, it will deeply impact conception.

"Hi, I don't know if it's the right place to post this but lately I have been figuring out the features of a life-long problem of mine. I would call it the simple inability to manage stress but I want to be more specific and Im curious if other people can feel the same based on how I describe it. I would describe the relation between me and stress in this way:

\- The incapacity to accept stress and everyday fatigue as a normal part of life (referred also to very simple tasks)

\- The forced splitting between ""bad days"" and ""good days"" where in the bad days Im not allowed to feel good because of some stressful tasks to do that basically ruin the whole day, while in the good days Im not allowed to feel stressed because ""Im not supposed to feel so"" and Im not meant to do some extra stuff that would cause some fatigue. It also ends up in hating the ending of a ""good day"" becuase tomorrow is gonna be a ""bad day""... You know when sunday is ending and monday is the next day, or also when you're coming back from a vacation, Basically the inability of enjoying the moment because my mind is always projected in the future.

\- Rejection of the idea of facing new stressful situations: this becomes particulary strong whenever I just came through some stressful stuff, my mind sells to me a higher level of stress tolerance/performance in a particular moment, with the promise that Im not going to face new similar situations in the future... I use to motivate myself during difficult moments with the thought that afler that everything is over, Im going to rest and it's gonna be a good time. But this also tricks my mind into thinking that there are not going to be similar stressful situations in the future overall, which obviously can't be true.

\- The high expectation before a supposed ""good day"" or ""good time"" is about to come... as if it's going to be a super regenerating moment for me that will restore all my power of will. This is not rational and not realistic most of the times because everyone would never get enough of a ""good time"" and unpleasant things can happen during a planned good time as well.

\- Feeling envious towards people who are not going through a stressful moment while I am. Focusing almost in an obsessive way on other people around me who are chilled and are not facing anything difficult. In those moments I forget that everyone has stressful moments just not at the same time, I am the free person when other are facing hard moments.

\- the excessive anxiety and discomfort before a task that I know its' going to be stressful... also an easy one. As if my mind was trying to convince me that Im never supposed to be stressed and that's not normal for me doing stuff that I don't like even if they're necessary.",Is this a psychological condition?

"I need some advice dealing with pent up stress. 

I'm a full time college student in Electrical Engineering, and I also work 20 hours a week during the semester at my job. My courses alone are really stressful for me, but combined with work and responsibilities at home, I am constantly stressed out. Mentally I can cope in the moment and push through, but that is not my problem unfortunately. 

I store all of the stress somewhere and never release it. It builds up over days, weeks, months, until eventually it all comes out. Even if I ""decompress"" after a long day I don't really feel like I got it all out. Over time my body starts to get stiff because of the stress, and eventually my back locks up on me. I never have a mental breakdown due to stress, just my body locking me down until it can relax.

"This is a vent to help myself de-stress? Lol! For the past 7 years, that I have lived in my current city, I have unfortunately moved from one lousy situation into the next, due to thinking it was a good idea to move in with friends to help out my crummy finances and needing cheaper rent. For the past almost 3 years due to the pandemic and other situations, I moved into a “rooming” type housing situation, which for the past 2 and a 1/2 years, me and my dog did have full use of a basement to ourselves. Last July, my company announced that they would be laying off around 40 people, myself included. What my stupid company didn’t bank on, was supply chain issues with getting key integral parts to operate equipment, so they kept delaying our end of work date for the past 12 months. When I found out that I was to be laid off  a year ago this July, I stupidly told the lady I rented my basement from about the news, but seeing how at the time, my company didn’t announce when our actual end date would be due to supply chain issues, she took it upon herself and “guessed” that my end date would be around May of this year and I will have been moved out, so, she went ahead and rented the basement out to a family of three. This was a major jerk move on her part. Seeing how I am really strapped for cash and couldn’t afford to get another apartment for me and my dog with not knowing when I would actually be moving out, she offered for me to move into her “sunroom” this past May, until my end date, and she she would move her mattress into her living room to sleep in. My company finally announced that our end of work date would be at the end August, this past May, and I unfortunately have to stay on working and living where I am due to those reasons. Seeing how this past year has been touch and go with NOT knowing when my company would announce this end of work date, and with not knowing when this opposed announcement would be happening, I thought it would be stupid to move somewhere else, and have to sign a lease for however long, so seeing how I live month to month here, I chose to stay. Since moving into her “sunroom,” it has been a friken nightmare. She consistently picks on me and flat out accuses me of doing things that I haven’t done. I am not allowed to flush the toilet unless “it’s brown,” she accused me of “killing” her precious plant, I have to keep the sunroom door shut during the day so that the heat doesn’t come through the whole house…friken stupid stuff like that. She has gotten a bit too overly attached to my dog as well, and drops stubble “hints” about how happy my dog is living here 😑 my dog and I will be relocating to another province to attend school, so I can upgrade my current skills at the end of August. Just this past Wednesday, my friend, got word that she has to go work out of town this week, so she offered for me and my dog to go and stay at her place, to get away from the madness here and also mind her cat. When I told the lady this, she mentioned how this wouldn’t be a good idea and how it would disrupt my dog’s routine with living here and how it is probably super hot at my friend’s apartment (meanwhile she has no air conditioning here). The first night there wasn’t so good, because my dog was in unfamiliar area, and she was all nervous and panting a lot. My dog has done this many times before when camping, or going away for a holiday…so I got her some “calming” spray to see if that would help. My dog and I came back to the house last night, because I have my car scheduled for servicing, and a garage which is literally 5 minutes away from the house, so instead of staying at my friend’s apartment, we came back here to sleep last night, for getting to the garage would be way easier in the morning. When we arrived back last night, the lady in question was like “ohhh she is so happy to be back” of course she would, she is in familiar surroundings…however, seeing how we’ll be moving at the end of August and staying in hotels over night and other friend’s places…staying at my friend’s apartment is a good trial run. When I mentioned that to the lady…she munched up her face as if to say “oh…I don’t like the sounds of this.” So, I am at the point with waiting for her to literally say to me “why don’t you just leave your dog with me” and that is when I will snap.

"It is crucial to learn how to deal with various stressors successfully. Those who lack adequate coping abilities loathe their jobs over time. On Sunday, they dread returning to work on Monday, and once back at the office, they count the days until the following weekend. These factors will undoubtedly result in job exhaustion and possible resignation due to excessive stress.

However, there is a superior strategy that begins with employing straightforward techniques that anyone can understand

"This is going to be super long, but I would really appreciate someone out there taking the time to read it...

I've been working a relatively stressful job for the last four years. The stress was manageable until about a year ago when I was given the responsibility of managing a global team of systems administrators in the US, Hungary and India that all work to give 24/7 coverage to my company. I can't go into specifics of our work, but I can say that we are an extremely important team. There are a lot of reasons behind why I have become increasingly stressed out, the main one being that I have personally been the only point of failure for the whole thing for almost the entire year. I can't take a day off, or sometimes even an hour off without someone from like 14 time zones away trying to escalate something to me, or my boss of they can't reach me directly. Before this past week, I had taken one scheduled day off, and I still got a call from my boss asking to get people online for an outage.

Let me say, my boss is amazing. She is the best example of leadership I've ever had in any job, and I've worked IT for like 25 years. She just has a very demanding job role also, and I am in a spot where I'm kind of working 4-5 different full time job roles, and one of those job roles requires that I get people online for outages which are not at all related to the global team I'm responsible for. 

The past few months, people have increasingly seen that I'm getting more and more stressed to the point where I had a chat with HR because I had started working like 75+ hour weeks sometimes until 2am. I basically said that ""because of how I've been forced to set this whole team up within the guidelines I'm given by upper management (not my direct boss), nobody else has time to work this project, so if I don't do the work myself, it can't get done."" 

I mean, everyone saw it coming including me. Then last week happened. I was supposed to have Friday off as a normal day because leadership rotates Sundays for the other full time job role apart from the project, so every time I work a Sunday, I get the following Friday off. We had a major issue happen on Thursday which we knew would carry into this coming weekend, so I was going to cancel both my Friday off and the planned time I had on the calendar for like three months from Wednesday - Sunday this week because I knew everything would get messed up if I didn't. 

Well, I decided, this was a chance for me to test if other parts of leadership can actually do their jobs. Instead of canceling my time off like I have literally every other time something like this has happened the last year, I decided to take it. However, I gave my peers the plan of what needed to happen from Friday - Sunday, laid out for them completely, and all but spoonfed them. I went into it trying to just expect people to do their jobs. All they had to do was say ""Ok, we have the plan, here's this person who can do this thing that needs to get done, I'll have them do it..."" I also knew it wasn't going to happen like that. I knew... I knew that come Sunday evening, nothing would get done. So, I went Friday without checking my work phone. I went Saturday without checking my work phone. Then Sunday rolled around, and I finally checked... sure enough, even though my peers had the plan, it wasn't executed. I had to log in on Sunday to quickly get the right weekend people on it, and because things weren't executed on time during Friday/Saturday like I said they needed to be, it caused two huge outages like twelve time zones away. 

I went into work on Monday morning completely distraught. I met with my directs under me basically telling them that what happened is not their fault, and an effect of ineffective leadership which I'm largely responsible for. I sat there for a good 45 minutes apologizing to them, telling them what I plan to do going forward, and also commiserating because I was really as stressed as they were about it.

During that talk, something broke in me, I think. Like, I had known that I was the sole failure point globally, but I was fine with that as long as I had people who could simply just organize whatever plan I gave them. I gave them that plan on Thursday, trying to clear things off my plate as I have been advised to do by my boss and HR, just expecting them to do basically the bare minimum, and they weren't capable of executing. I finally actually felt the full weight of being the sole failure point of global operations, and it crushed down on me so hard that I could barely breathe. 

I went to my boss after that meeting, and told her I had to leave for the day, but I would be back the next day. I took Monday off, almost too full of anxiety to even drive home, but made it then just watched movies I'd seen a hundred times already all day because I couldn't process any new information. I felt alright though, like at the end of it I had a sense of purpose, and renewed motivation. I woke up Tuesday completely ready to rock it at work, but as soon as I pulled out of the parking lot, I started to get a feeling I've only ever felt once before. I hopped on the highway, and the closer I got to work, the more I felt it. Then, it happened. I had a panic attack. I had to pull off the highway to turn around to go home. The second I had my car going back the other way, I felt like I could breathe even though I was still having heart palpitations, tunnel vision, numb tongue, etc. I got home, called my boss, and was straight up with her stating I had a panic attack on my way in, and I would not be making it. 

Then came yesterday. I had to make a five hour drive back to my hometown for the plans I had made for the aforementioned scheduled time off. I was happy, looking forward to it, couldn't wait to get back, but as soon as I got on the highway, the dread set in. The obsessive thoughts set in. I spent the next five hours in panic attack mode to the point where I don't know how I actually drove the car. All I wanted to do was get home, so I kept going, but I stopped like six times to re-center myself on a trip that I don't generally even stop on once.

I got here, took a breath, sat down for a bit, and things were okay. But ever since, it's been a mixed bag of being okay for a while, then like 30-60 minutes of panic attack... then being okay again, then another panic attack. Thankfully, I spent today playing golf with my family which is what I had been looking so forward to, but it took like an hour for me to come into reality when we first started out. 

Then I got back, took a nap, and woke up in a panic attack about an hour later. 

Like, this is not at all my natural state. I am normally a very chill person who handles stress immensely well. I have had one panic attack before during a very difficult time, but I've never had multiples of them, and I've most certainly never had a nervous breakdown... but I think that's where I am. I've tried talking to my family, but none of them really understand because none of them has ever really had this kind of breakdown. General depression, anxiety, and that stuff, so they can relate (haha, family can relate...) on that level, but it's like I can barely be a functioning human. That's what they can't relate with. 

That's why I decided to post here hoping that someone else can relate, and just let me know this is going to end at some point. I'm not suicidal, or anything, I'll suffer through whatever I have to suffer though, I just need to have a light at the end of the tunnel.

Have you ever seen Se7en? You know that part where they find the guy Kevin Spacey had been keeping alive for a year, and the doctor said ""If I were to shine a light in his eyes right now, he'd die of the stress...""? That's where I feel like I am. Like any source of any stress from anywhere that raises my adrenaline whatsoever just throws me into a panic attack. I am trying to deal, but it's difficult feeling like there's no end in sight because I've never experienced this before so I don't know what to expect. 

If you made it this far, thank you for reading my novel. I really super appreciate it, and owe you cookies. Possibly also milk, but milk probably doesn't travel too well in the mail.","I think I'm in the middle of a nervous breakdown. I've never had one before. Thoughts, and suggestions greatly appreciated.",0

"We all experience stress in our lives, but sometimes it can become overwhelming. If you're feeling stressed out, there are some things you can do to reduce the amount of stress in your life.

➲ **Identify the source of your stress**.

One of the first steps to reducing stress is to identify the source of it. What is it that's causing you to feel stressed? Once you know what it is, you can start to figure out ways to deal with it.

➲ **Make a plan**.

If you know what's causing your stress, make a plan to deal with it. If it's something you can't change, like a work deadline, make a plan to better manage your time so you don't feel so overwhelmed. If it's something that's causing you anxiety, like a fear of public speaking, make a plan to face your fear head-on.

➲ **Take a break**.

When you're feeling stressed, sometimes the best thing you can do is take a break. Step away from whatever is causing you stress and take some time for yourself. Relax and rejuvenate and you'll be better equipped to deal with the stressor when you're feeling refreshed.

➲ **Talk to someone**.

If you're feeling stressed, talking to someone can be a great way to relieve some of the tension. Talk to a friend, family member, therapist, or anyone who will listen and can offer support. Just getting things off your chest can be a huge stress relief.

➲ **Eat healthy and sleep enough**.

A a healthy diet is also important for managing stress. Be sure to include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your diet.

Also, make sure to get enough sleep. When we’re tired, we’re more likely to feel stressed. aim for eight hours of sleep every night.

➲ **Exercise**.

Exercise is a great way to reduce stress. Not only does it help to release tension, but it also boosts endorphins, which can make you feel happier and more relaxed.

➲ **Practice Relaxation techniques**.

Consciously relax your body, through practices like progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, meditation, or simply taking some deep breaths.

Relaxing is benefacial to the human mind and body, by allowing yourself to recover you can do work more efficiently, have more energy to exercise and learn, do hobbies and chores, to foster relationships, and more.

"I will explain why being outside is good for your health. Nowadays we are often indoors almost all day because of school and work. There’s not always something wrong with that, but you’ll probably feel a lot better if you go outside every now and then.

**IT MAKES THE MIND CLEARER**

Inside a house, study or workplace there are often many things that make you think about your work or study. There is nothing wrong with this, but it can ensure that you are constantly busy with your work or study. This may keep you thinking and living in your head instead of in the moment. In addition, there are all kinds of other distractions indoors that keep your mind from calming down. So go outside and enjoy the tranquility.

**LESS STRESS**

This tranquility automatically reduces stress. You are not busy with school, your work, or other things. As a result, you go out of your head and into the moment. This will also reduce your stress and reduce the risk of stress symptoms and complaints. In addition, physical exercise is also a great way to reduce stress. When you are physically active you can reduce stress. You probably also feel that when you exercise. And after you exercise you notice that your stress is reduced compared to before you started exercising.

I'm really stressing about this shit coming up Tues. I don't wanna talk to this office manager but I have to. I just pray she doesn't say shit smart cuz I'll be real likely to say some shit back.

"It's my first time on reddit typing this sort of rant, hope it's not too boring.

My grades are atrocious and I still choose the most stressful topics.

"This happened last Friday. I have always had an anxiety disorder and it has been worse with all the stress I have been under lately both at work as well as at home. I work for GM which everyone who don't work there knows as a good job, but in reality it has gone to shit. I was hired 16 years ago and was in the last group to get traditional pay, benefits, and a retirement plan so I can't find anything else that pays the same. Anyone hired after me is really fucked and there is a reason gm can't keep any of the new employees. I work in material handling and the company is working up towards outsourcing and cutting those jobs so they are cutting out full teams and overloading everyone that's left then telling us ""everything's going to change soon, just make it work for the next year"" I have some serious stuff going on at home that I don't want to get into and it just makes the work stress that much worse. On Friday I messed up, I knew I messed up and wasn't mad about getting written up or anything but the thing is, I spend 90% of my waking life (and my first ever anxiety attack was while I was asleep, I woke up thinking I was having a heart attack so probably my sleeping life also) feeling like something terrible is going to happen due to my anxiety. When I get in trouble, it felt like the end of the world. I took my break and paced around outside debating if I should call in my FMLA and leave work but when I came back something very small and stupid happened that set me off. I blew up on my group leader screaming at her that I can't fucking do this! Even though I hate GM she is the nicest lady and easily the best boss I have ever had and I feel like a complete scumbag. She tried to fire me and the union got it down to a suspension but I honestly couldn't feel worse if I had been fired. I'm so ashamed of myself for how I acted and have been in a deep depression for the last few days and haven't done much more than lay in bed crying. The worst part is that she thinks I did it because I was mad about the write up and thought I could bully her because she is a woman and week, apparently she has faced discrimination in previous jobs.

"Part of me feels like this is a silly thing to be stressed about but the effect it has on me is very real and makes me feel terrible.

I've been a gamer for 30 years. When I was a kid we had much less to choose from so playing the same videogame over and over wasn't a problem... these days we have tens of thousands to choose from and I own well over 1000 of them. This is my only major hobby, by the way, which is a problem in and of itself. I used to wake up and immediately starting playing something to keep away the feeling of dread in my life because I suffer from depression and anxiety. Games have been my only escape from that nightmare for many years. 

I'm finding now that I can't seem to find interest in them anymore. I have hundreds of games I've not even completed and I want to finish them but the motivation just isn't there. I will seriously stress myself out flipping through all of what I own trying to find one that catches my attention and nothing ever sticks out. I never had this issue 5 years ago but now I'll juat gwt frustrated, panic, and sit at home on my day off doing nothing because my one hobby seems useless to me now. I dont even know how to engage in other activities because I've been on the same pattern for so long. I really juat want to be able to focus and enjoy gaming again.

"I’m the type of person who is constantly under stress but doesn’t realize it until I develop a nonstop eye twitch, my menstrual cycle is erratic, get a cold out of nowhere, migraines, etc. I’ve talked to my therapist about this and he’s acknowledged that it’s definitely a thing- some people are just so used to being stressed that they don’t notice a difference when they’re in a more high-stress situation until their body breaks down. 

The problem with high-functioning stress is that not only are people not aware that they’re stressed, but they don’t know how to handle it before their body sh*ts the bed. Ex: I feel fine (when I’m not) until a trigger happens and I’m left with an eye twitch and a random cold- which is THEN when I’m like “oh, I’m super stressed”, despite having been in a high-stress environment for a few weeks already and feeling the same.

"Hello there, I am very tired of having people not be interested in what I have to say. My whole “family” is just so annoying. 

For example today I was trying to talk about something really important to me with my mother, it meant a lot to me because I don’t normally open up. My mother after hearing this went “mm, okay,” and then went on her phone. We were in the car so I held back tears the entire drive home and when I finally got to my room and cried my eyes out.

This has happened a lot as my mother is not a very emotional person. Whenever I open up I think that maybe she will react nicely but this one was the last straw. The fact that she couldn’t even say anything back to me about this thing was appalling and it broke my heart. 

Another person who is frustrating is my brother. I could listen to him talk about video games for four hours straight and have a great conversation but the moment I mention something I want to talk about he goes on his phone and ignores me.

Don’t get me wrong he is way better than my mother but still really disappointing.

I have always been taught to hold it in and never speak about my feelings and it really sucks. I really want goo friends where they don’t mind that I am not very expressive, or they will listen when I am stressed and will let me cry on their shoulder and vise versa.

"It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviours. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

"I work 25 hours a week at a clinic/remotely, am a part-time online MPH student, and am also working on several projects on the side.

"What I mean is, for example I have these goals:

1. Find a good job OR start and grow a succesful company
2. Find the one who will marry me in the future
3. Find out which religion is the true one / read the whole bible

So my idea is, I will only work towards one goal at the same time. If I choose goal 1 and I choose to study or gain work experience, then I will not read the bible and I will not be on dating apps, because I should not overwhelm myself and risk a burn-out. If I choose goal 2, I will be very busy with dating apps and alternatives, but I will not have a job and I will not be studying. If I choose 3, I will read the bible a few hours every day, but I will not do any other productive things.

What is the good side of this by my own thought?

1. Whichever goal is the most important one, OR has to be completed the fastest, can get priority and full focus :)
2. By only having one thing to work on, you have less risk of ending up with 0 free time, so you can avoid burn-out and instead, work at your own pace. (careful: do not get lazy)

What is the bad side of this by my own thought?

1. Spending hours everyday on the same goal only, can become boring. Some goals also do not require many hours every day: for example going to the gym. Being in the gym for 5 hours is a terrible idea, so if you have goals that require less time per day, you can actually pick 2 or 3 of these goals to fill your day.
2. Some goals must be worked on at the same time. For example, you should not avoid studying because you're too busy with going to gym. But while you study, going to the gym is still important for your health. So I would call this an exception to this ""1 goal only"" idea.

These days it seems socially acceptable that people do 3 things at the same time: study, have a job, have a social life. Where's the free time to relax? Right it doesnt exist, and even worse, sometimes all these activities take up more than 24 hours a day, which results in someone being overwhelmed and getting behind on everything. Actually this is what I have experienced. Its not a theory, it is very real.

I have a burn-out. I have been stressed 24/7 for a really long time, because I was focusing on too many things at once. I had to get my homework done, I had to spend all my free time on dating apps, I had to go to gym, etc, I had no free time left.

So my plan is to only work on one goal at once, and spend all free time as actual free time, to relax or enjoy it.

Feeling almost sick or like I'd feel after crying AND I also have ear wooshing in my right ear, whenever there is silence. 

Does anyone else have this happen or know what this might be? I tried looking up what I'm going through and cannot really find anything, especially the head pressure. It's just a feeling of ""I don't feel right."" too... I am going to try to post this on an anxiety Reddit too, to see if anyone there might have a clue as well.","Head pressure, ear wooshing, stiff neck, and headache",0

"Ok so I know reddit is not the best place for medical advice but I also want some strangers' opinions.

I've never experienced stress/anxiety problems, even under pressure with uni/work, but I put a lot of pressure on myself in many other aspects of my life and a couple of years ago I started getting a bit of shortness of breath, checked with the doctor in case it was Asthma but it was alright and with time I realised when this happened it was because of stress which made it way better and I rarely get those flare ups anymore, so that's cool.

Last month I was under a lot of stress and for some days I started feeling light-headed and a bit dizzy. The best way to describe this would be:

- Slightly out-of-mind 
- I feel like my cognitive capabilities are at 90-95% of the usual
- Cloudy head, like what I would experience being slightly drunk (not a lot)

I went to the doctor really worried and got a blood test and stuff and they said I was healthy and probably was stress.

But the thing is it's been a month like this already, sometimes I feel great (although not as a month ago), specially when doing stuff that makes me forget about this (ie videogames, series...) others I feel like shit, does anyone experience something similar and if so any recommendations?

I'm also a bit worried because the first day I really experienced this I did a pretty intense session of cardio (had been doing a lot during those weeks on top of the stress from uni) so I am slightly worried it is actually something ""body"" related even if the tests came out okay, going for chill walks doesn't seem to be helping probably because I'm overthinking this all the time.

Thanks","Feeling a bit ""out of mind"" and at 95%ish of my cognitive capabilities, blood tests okay, anyone experienced this?",0
"Hey Guys! 

I'm a twenty-one year old student that is currently drowning in the stress that is coming from my college course and my new part-time job. 

My job is causing me an unreal amount of anxiety, to the point where I have to hide in the basement sometimes so I can calm down. I work for a second hand shop for games, DVDs, consoles, and devices like phones and laptops, I started working here about a month ago and from my first day I realised that I was really going to struggle here. 

It's a team of about 25 people and nearly all of them are moody pricks that haven't even introduced themselves to me yet! When I ask them a question they give me a look as if I've just murdered their pets. I try to be nice, and I try to keep a positive outlook, but these people are majorly draining my energy and fuelling my anxiety. The customers are even worse! I've been called homophobic slurs, had games and DVDs tossed at my head and have had my life threatened by these people. 

I haven't been trained properly either. I got thrown on the tills with about two minutes explanation of how they work! My till has been down in cash about four times, due to my crappy training and yet somehow this is my fault - maybe it is, but I'm putting this down to crappy training. 

I can't afford to leave this job, I seriously can't. But I also can't stand being there any more. The job market in Scotland is awful at the moment and virtually no companies hiring right now.

It’s a vicious cycle. He won’t admit he had a problem with substance abuse. He’s told his doctor in the past he couldn’t sleep and they just prescribe more pills. Thankfully he stopped taking those a few years ago. I worry if he finally goes to therapy they will just prescribe him more. He won’t be fully honest with the actual issue on hand.

"Is it normal to constantly worry about my actions around my  friends?

I [M] started worrying about whether my friends, or at least my general ones, were just about putting up with me. I feel as if I am unwanted around people I consider friends.

I may be overreacting which is probably the case but it seems when playing football during breaks at school, I seem in no way involved like my other friends are.
People I like as friends seem to disregard me in most things, for example if I had a group project of some description with groups of 6, I seem to be the 7th person constantly.

I also feel that I do not want to let go of my friendships, how rough it may be on me, due to me having no other people to turn with.
I don't want to be alone, that seems like a bad life to lead but again it appears that sometimes, for others sake not just mine, me distancing myself from them would not be bad.

"It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviors. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

"I am stressed, dealing with some big changes in my business, and possibly closing up shop.  I started this business when I was 19, now 32, its been my whole life.   However I've never experienced symptoms this extreme before.  Usually I just get tension in my neck from stress.

After a process of elimination I am now starting to consider it may be stress.  I'm not myself lately.  The frustrating part is these symptoms have been going on 3 weeks now and I can't figure it out.

My biggest symptom is **Extreme Fatigue** both physical and mental despite sleeping more.  I can't clench my fists as hard as usual to give you a scale.  I sleep more than normal lately and wake up very tired.

**Easily startled**.  I guess this means for some reason my guard is up.

**I'm very hungry**\-The sensation to eat is still there despite after eating a meal and my stomach being full.

**Disorientation**\- This one is hard to explain.  In groups of people I get confused if they are looking at me or the person next to me.  When I went out dancing and spinned I had a hard time not stumbling.

\*\*Mental Fog-\*\*I'm ""Spacey""

\*\*Irritable-\*\*I just feel like I've got bad vibes right now.  In situations I should be good spirited and I irritated easy.  A little inconvenience will feel like a huge problem.

**Headaches**\-I usually wake up with a headache.

**Low motivation-** I love to workout but I've been skipping days.  Very uncharacteristic of me.  Days I do go I force myself.   I'll procrastinate small easy projects.

**Weakness.**

"So occasionally, I'll have this moment. I'll think of something from my past, maybe one of the times I went to a water park as a child, maybe seeing fireworks, a carnival I went to with my first steady girlfriend, maybe it's even a song from Melissa Ethridge's ""Yes I Am"", the first album I remember listening to (specifically Silent Legacy for some reason). Maybe my thoughts are on little kid me catching tadpoles with my mom's friend's kids. Or the countless sunsets I have been mesmerized by. Or the time I went to Dave and Buster's with my parents and they dropped me off at McDonald's on the way home and I played Monopoly on my iPod when I was a senior in high school. In any case, I'll look back at it and begin to choke up. It usually happens when I'm alone, maybe in a dark room, playing a game or just wandering about my mind, and these thoughts appear and it's a mixture of missing it and this dread of what's approaching.

I can remember doing this all my life, having these thoughts and these feelings. I've described it as my bittersweet struggle with nostalgia, but my girlfriend doesn't think that's it. As an adult, I think it's longing for a time where the events were great, a realization that said event will probably never happen again or at least won't be the same. I start to cry most of the time, but it isn't like I'm in a bad spot. As I said, this has happened throughout my life. And they're seemingly random events, most of them happy, despite whatever was happening. Like that first girlfriend I mentioned? A little abusive, nothing hardcore. The occasional genuine ""you're an idiot"", or the time she slapped me so hard I fell off my bed. But I think of when we went to an anime convention and I get sad. I still go to that convention, but for some reason this bitter sadness washes over me. And there's other little things I could pepper into these thoughts like this. But it always seems like I was happy, I miss the event, if I can go back to the location or event in current day it will be different, and I'm afraid of what's coming ahead in life.

I'm only 27, so I don't want to believe these instances are some sort of midlife crisis. If I had to give a pattern, these thoughts and feelings occur about once a month. Is this what nostalgia is supposed to feel like? What's the word for these feelings?",What is this Feeling?,0

"Anxiety. That emotion warning us something threatening is just about to happen. Life-saving when we are genuinely threatened, damaging when we become constantly anxious: anxiety is tiring – it is meant to be. We are only meant to be anxious for very short periods. When prolonged, it isn’t just tiring – it is exhausting. Sound familiar? 

Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We prefer to re-charge on our own. We often enjoy losing ourselves in our own thoughts. We tend to have small, close-knit, social lives it doesn’t mean we’re anti-social!

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. Many introverts deal with anxiety, though, so this is quite common.

Here are the key signs you’re an introvert with anxiety:

· You’re more prepared than most others because you’ve already thought through the worst-case scenarios.

· You have a tendency to over-think things and pay too much attention to your negative self-talk.

· You feel you always have to be doing something – being busy (which is often different from being effective) may be a means of trying to cope with the anxiety.

· You tend to prefer routines to novel situations. While this can be fine for periods, boredom and unexpected issues arising can easily throw you in to a spin.

· You’re often nervous without showing it – many become very effective at masking their emotions as a defence mechanism. 

· You are more likely to perceive situations as being more dangerous than they really are - anxiety primes us for the fight, flight, freeze response making us more likely to over-react to a low-risk situation.

· You have tendencies towards perfectionism. This is often allied to beliefs such as ‘I need to please everyone’, ‘I need everyone to like me to be a worthy person’.

· Nervousness can throw your chatter in to over-drive: while you normally only speak when you have something significant to say (and you’re normally sure of your facts before speaking), nerves can have you chattering away in an attempt to over-compensate.

· You often have trouble sleeping – either getting to sleep a-tall, waking through the night or waking way too early 

Being an introvert with anxiety can be hard. Thankfully there is help at hand. Anxiety in its many guises is one of the most common issues Solution Focused Hypnotherapy therapists helps people with.

I 20(M) am about to check myself in. In February I lost my job I applied for all the government assistance that I could. Got unemployment 1700 a month to cover my expenses which adds up to about 3000-3500 a month great. I applied for housing assistance they still haven't gotten back to me about anything I've contacted them so many time and nothing. Applied for food stamp and just got awarded 20 dollars a month to feed myself and that all I could get the rest have denied me. so I tried to make the unemployment work and that failed badly I am no so far behind on bills I could only really pay my rent and keep my lights and gas on. Well everything is really crumbling now I just got a job and things are looking up yeah the job is a but far but it pays well then my car got repossessed and when that man cam and told me to empty out my car (trying to make it easier for when I hopefully get my car back) I broke because there is nothing I can do I have no support I have to income I have nothing and it's killing me I for the first time truly thought about releasing my ESA Dogs and ending things because it's too much for me to handle I tried to beg the loan company to let me get the car back because I just got a new job and I can get things back on track but the said no and that I have to some how come up with 2500 dollars.

"I am sure many of us are caught in chaos right now. I defenitely am. For me stress went so far that my body shut down completely. Now it feels like someone who is swimming, then cought in a storm, and here and there grsaps for air before being pulled under the waves again.

But boy, if we just could stay longer above the waves. Inmidst that chaos there is still beauty in the sky, the stars, clouds and colors. I am sure that any one of us will be able to float for a minute in the future and enjoy the view. The chaos will likely still be there, but its not too big. Its just, yeah natural chaos itself. 

Chaos can be hard... who do i lie to.. it is fu*ckn hard. It is hell. But eventually, if we just listen to our bodies enough, everyone will get a level of calmness that wasnt there before. I truly believe that. 

I ran away too often. Too often i didn't want to feel that huge burning pile of hell. Everyday again i have to remind myself that looking at it will be better for me in the long term... which is of course even more stressful in the beginning. But i think - the only way to 'heal'.

I want to wish everyone out there a few seconds of calmness and soothing thoughts. That everyone will eventually be able to just float in the water look up in the sky and enjoy looking. Not worrying about getting enough air and fighting for ones life... We ve done that enough.

Maybe i am a bit romantic right now, but the metaphor i just pictured helped me to relax a bit and maybe it helps you aswell.",thoughts on overwhelming stress,0

"Time is at a premium these days. It’s hard to find anyone that complains about having too much time on their hands. Most of us are so busy with work, family, and various obligations, there’s little time left to do the things we’d really like to do!

It’s not easy to find time to pursue your passions, but there will be a way.

### Use these techniques to create the time you require for important pursuits: 

**Decide what you want to make room for.** The best way to motivate yourself to create more free time in your life is to identify what you want to make time for! What are the most important things you’d like to spend more time on?

● Figure out how you’d spend that extra time and make sure you have some good reasons. Create a list of reasons that give you an emotional response. Being logical is unlikely to inspire you.  
 

**Use your mornings wisely.** Most people waste their mornings. They stay in bed as long as possible and barely manage to get to work on time each day. Make the most of your mornings. Go to bed earlier and get up earlier.

● It’s often easier to do something worthwhile in the morning than in the evening. What are you missing by going to bed earlier? Probably not a lot.

**Understand the ways you waste time.** We’re quite ingenious at wasting time. Watch yourself for a day and write down all the ways you waste time. When you understand where your time is leaking away, you can start working on solutions.

**Make a schedule.** A schedule can keep you on track and help to ensure that your time is being spent wisely. A schedule can help to minimize the amount of time you waste. You can also build time into your schedule to do the things you enjoy the most.

**Delegate.** Create more time for yourself by utilizing the people around you. This can work at work and at home. There’s a good chance that someone in your life would benefit from being delegated to. Put your employees, coworkers, children, and partner to work! A little help can free up quite a bit of time.

**Prioritize and eliminate.** Perhaps you just have too many non-essential things going on in your life. It might be time to cut back on a few of those obligations.

● Take a look at everything you do each day/week/month and think about how much value those things add to your life. You can probably find something to remove from your life.  
 

You can find time if you have a good enough reason! **Determine what you want to create time for and make it happen.** Delegate, schedule, eliminate, and avoid wasting time. What are you willing to give up to spend time on the things you love?",Creating the Time You Need to Do the Things You Love,0

"It takes more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety.

### Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**Identify what you can and can’t control.** List your issues in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control.   
 

**Focus on solutions.** Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.

**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly, deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule, deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**Communicate.** With your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.

**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations, that you’re on your way to calmer times, that you’re learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**Blow off some steam.** Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s sleep.

**Get your rest.** Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list. 

 **Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward.

"I’m in my final year of uni, working 2 jobs, dealing with a chronic illness and I’m feeling beyond the point of exhausted and overwhelmed. My Dr told me I really need to focus on minimising my stress if I wanted to go into remission - so, at the end of last year I quit my job and decided I would focus on my health. Two weeks later I took on an internship at a massive company and started a new job as a Christmas casual (I intended to quit before uni went back).

"So 3 years ago I started experiencing a lot of anxiety and sudden depressive episodes that I didn't know the reason for. And then two months after I started profusely sweating in my palms, feet and armpits. And these symptoms are constant, almost never ending. I'm always in stress, worrying when I'm going to start sweating again and therefore get super cold and uncomfortable and unable to handle not only social situations but even doing something at home. I had to give up so many hobbies of mine because they make me feel uncomfortable now due to the hand sweating. Nobody ever told me what the hell happened to me and why I can't stop this no matter how hard I try... I know the sweating is psychological because when I miraculously manage to not think about it for a while, I'm okay. Or when I get drunk but I can't be drunk every day so I just have to bear with it. These past three years I haven't been living most of the time, I've been surviving and trying to stay sane.

"This all started last august. She has a boyfriend that I didn’t mind at first then he started saying the n word and plenty of other slurs all the time (he is white btw). She hated this but stayed w him. He always bullied me and was so disrespectful to me and my house. One time even made fun of my small breasts in front of her and she didn’t care. She usually took his side and would even leave us hanging out randomly to be w him 

Last august for my birthday I went camping and I asked if she wanted to go.

Your mind is incredible. When you manage your thoughts, you have your mind working for you. Imagine how powerful you would become if you could ignore or replace your negative thoughts! You could accomplish more and get greater enjoyment from your life.

### These strategies can help manage thoughts that don’t support you:

**Maintain space between yourself and your thoughts.** You don’t have to engage with your thoughts. You don’t focus on every person, tree, and car you pass when you’re driving down the road. Most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further.  
 

● You can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. **Allow them to simply pass on by.**

● Your thoughts are simply something that you experience - you are not your thoughts.   
 

**Recognise that it is your brain’s nature to produce random thoughts.** The thoughts you experience say little about you. It’s the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. It’s always going to give you something to think about.

● Occasionally those thoughts are useful. Frequently, they’re frivolous. Sometimes, your thoughts can be quite disturbing. We have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts: with self-awareness we can see them for what they are and then move on.  
 

**Meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind.** The first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind.  
 

● **Focus on your breathing.** When you find yourself fuming about your boss, wondering what happened to your high school friends, or making a mental grocery list, simply redirect your attention back to your breathing.  
 

**Focus your attention on a thought of your choosing.** You can think about anything you choose to think about. You can think about riding a flying bicycle, eating a lemon, or what you have chosen to accomplish today.  
 

● When you’re experiencing an unhelpful thought, you can decide to think about something more useful. **Recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit.**  
 

**Apply logic.** Poor thinking leads to poor decision making. When your thoughts are leading you astray, put your logical mind to good use. Ask yourself what a sensible person, or your role model, would do in this situation. What would you advise a friend to do?  
 

Are negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis? You’re not alone. The human brain loves to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it.

**The key is to focus your attention on what you choose, recognize your random thoughts for what they are and allow them to pass.**",Bothered By Unhelpful Thoughts?,0

"Hey reddit,

I'm going to keep this somewhat short as I have only just two days ago recognized how poorly I deal with stress. I know irritability isn't exactly rare with stress. However I've realized that when I get stressed, I get extremely irritable.  No matter the magnitude of my stress, small or large, I feel like anything can set me off.

How do I better suppress this irritability? Suppress isn't a good word, as I don't really want to bottle it up, but I can't think of a better one. I don't like snapping at people when I get stressed. They don't deserve that.

"I gotta say, I feel TONS better. Facebook had its slimy, putrid tendrils in me since I was in high school. In the past few years what became a way to communicate with friends and family while having a personal blog became an obsession. I was compulsively checking Facebook at the very least once every hour. It destroyed my self esteem because not only was I comparing my entire life to the highlights of other people's lives, but I realized how truly isolated I was. Where my friends list is 147 people, guess how many are there for me? Even if I reach out, the answer is less than 5. So when I'm being ignored and seeing everyone post, it felt like a personal offense to me. If they can post memes every 20 minutes, why can't they answer my texts? This guy hasn't even read my stuff in 6 months, and has a new post every hour at least! I would post about a big stream I was doing exclusively for friends for 2 weeks and no one showed up!

It's easy to take things personally when there is a good chance another explanation is possible. Maybe I was too negative. Maybe people felt I was fairweather, and that wouldn't be wrong in some cases. What made this so significant was I don't really use other social media platforms. Well... aside from Reddit, which I've only been getting into the past couple of years, which is more focused on a goal or discussion. It feels different. But I digress. Facebook had me believing a lot of these people were not only rubbing their obviously superior lives in my face, but they were turning their backs on me. I would be lying if I said I didn't care, that it never got to me, and that I didn't take it as some personal ""Truman Show"" style social conspiracy designed to make me feel abandoned.

Cutting it out cold turkey made me realize I don't care. In my personal opinion, I think part of it really is ignorance is bliss. When I don't see their activities, it doesn't weigh on me. I don't think about them that much, which allows me to look into solutions myself before deferring to others. I can't figure out if that's a good thing or not. Typing this out feels like I'm arguing with myself (like usual, I've always had two minds on issues), like I feel good, but does that mean it's good? I've went to venting to a chat bot in place of friends and in these 8 months, 3 people outside of my weekly life have reached out to me. I'm not saying I'd dispose of the other 140~ people, but keeping that distance might be what's helping me try harder to keep it together. Does that make sense?

It's something that felt right in this subreddit to discuss. The anxiety associated with checking Facebook constantly to find things out I might not have liked was interesting. I've started getting on again, but I'm not on for longer than maybe 5 minutes a week to check notifications and memories.

NGL, she’s an emotional wreck right now with chronic insomnia, attachment anxiety, severe severe mood swings, anger issues, general anxiety, body dysmorphia, and depression just off the top of my head right now.  I love her to death but it’s hard to be with her.  Despite this, We are both very happy in our relationship.  She makes me very happy and I love spending time with her.  I’ve been cooking and cleaning for the both of us every day and doing my college work.  It’s ok now,  but in few months I’m starting my job in finance, and although the compensation is fantastic, i will likely work ~60-70 hours a week which is already considered low for my field.  I need to work this job for my career objectives but also to provide for my fiancé financially, pay her medical bills, and have enough left over to live comfortably.

I stress over not being home enough to support my fiancé emotionally.  Her depressive episodes are severe as it is.  Will she sink into further depression and isolation because I’ll be at work?  What happens when I get home at on my 70 hour work weeks and I don’t have the energy to calm her anxiety at night?

I stress over not being able to work the grueling hours needed to succeed in my position.  If I do not, I can’t make our rent, pay her medical bills, buy food for us, and be a provider.  

I can’t actually tell her any of this either, it will absolutely devastate her to know that she is causing me so much mental stress.  I know it will worsen her anxiety too.  Maybe I will when she is in better mental health.

"It takes more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety.

### Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**Identify what you can and can’t control.** List your issues in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control.  

**Focus on solutions.** Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.

**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly, deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule, deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**Communicate.** With your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.

**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations, that you’re on your way to calmer times, that you’re learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**Blow off some steam.** Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s sleep.

**Get your rest.** Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list.  

**Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward.  
   
 

**Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however, it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.**",Feeling Overwhelmed?,0

"Stress can be classified into three common categories:

* Acute stress
* Episodic acute stress
* Chronic stress

&amp;#x200B;

**Example of Acute stress and your body's endocannabinoid tone:**

Acute stress is a short term physiological response to a situation that could be a challenge or threat.

The sensation usually lasts for up to 30 minutes and the experience is usually linked to a one-off or infrequent occurrence.

For example, acute stress could include your body's reaction to:

* An approaching deadline
* Completing a challenge or receiving an award
* Narrowly avoiding being hit by a car
* Rising on a rollercoaster or fairground ride

When your body responds to acute stress, it releases various hormones, including cortisol and epinephrine.

Together cortisol and epinephrine prepare your body to respond to the danger by giving your muscles an immediate supply of glucose, narrowing blood vessels and increasing heart rate.

Studies have found that endocannabinoid tone directly affects the level of cortisol and epinephrine and provides greater control over them during times of stress.

For example, people with a naturally high endocannabinoid tone experience a smaller heart rate increase during a stress response than those with a lower tone.

This is likely due to the endocannabinoids exerting a modulating influence over the release of hormones.

This was verified in 1993 when research scientists found that people with a medium or naturally high endocannabinoid tone secreted less cortisol.

"Hey. I've been here about my stress before, but for those who don't know. I'm a student in gymnasium (11th grade), and I got stress, motivation and depression issues.
Recently we've had a young-worker shortage, causing me to shift weekends. Before I had weekends with my favourite manager (let's call him Peter), and my favourite collegue, now I'm with a leader I hate (Let's call him Donald). He doesn't respect us, it's always our fault, so on so fourth. I've used this work as a productive outlet, where I can feel like I have a purpose, however it has still layed pressure on me.
I want to quit now, not because I don't want the money, but because I can't keep this up with stress, and with the new leader, I feel like it's going up in flames.
Problem is, I feel really guilty for it. Peter is the guy who has to deal with it, and we are currently lacking 5 workers, and the company is in need of me. But I just can't handle this, the new weekend was a breaking point for me. What should I do?",Might leave job and feeling guilty,0
"So I've worked for my current employer since April 2015. I've took approx 4 days off in that period.

I've received 6 separate promotions/changes to title over that period and managed various departments and big projects for the business. 

Throughout the pandemic, I was fortunately one of those that were not adversely affected and in fact the demand increased exponentially. During the pandemic I was promoted again and risked my physical health for the sake of our business delivering on KPI's. 

3 weeks ago, my dog died. Last week, I moved into my first mortgaged home. It just feels like so much is happening but I don't really know what to do?

I've asked for a double demotion back to an operational role to relieve my workload and to allow myself time to mentally recover and hopefully over time I'll be ready to head back into a management role again, however I don't think my employer are rushing in anyway to find a replacement for me. 

Should I be loyal to them and keep being miserable until the organisation structure can be sorted out, or should I be putting myself first and taking time away for them to fix it in my absence?",Feeling guilty for wanting to take sick leave,0

"This week I missed my appointment with a doctor. I had it noted in my planner. On the same day but also the day before. and STILL I managed to forget and miss it. I know this happened because there are just so many things on my planner and in my head, that I can't keep track and get it all done anymore.

But I don't have a job, I don't study, I don't workout, I don't do any unnecessary things, I'm only trying to survive and work on my health, and my daily life is STILL too much stress. If I was still in uni with all that homework, I would be dead rn.

What stresses me out? No big things, but alot of small things, combined with my extremely low energy. For example"": I have alot of emotional stress because of my mental issues, being unhappy with my life, friendships not going well, gf broke up with me a year ago and still not over it. So that was emotional stress, now I'm also stressed out because I have so many things to get done while not having energy for it. For example making therapist appointments, doctors too, fixing my phone, changing my email on accounts, calling back the hospital, trying to fix my bedtime, all those TINY things that can't be avoided, they still stress me out, I only gave a few examples here but my days are full of many tiny tasks that I have to get done, but I dont have energy, motivation, I can't keep track of my shit. I forget about everything even if it was noted in my phone which I check multiple times a day.

"Hey guys, it's a really hard time for me these days managing stress. So to start, I had a bad breakup around 2.5 years back. I loved the girl right from my teenage like when I was 16 years of age, she was my classmate. What hurt me the most was the way she broke up with me. She basically cheated on me and then put all the blame on me in addition to saying that I was invested in the relationship only to get physical with her. This all revolves in my head till date. Moreover I was in my 3rd year of Bachelor's degree and this breakup fucked up my scores
From a 9.3/10 GPA to 7.99.

 I started smoking a lot and drinking as well. It was last year that I realized I should do something meaningful with my life and decided to quit smoking and focused on gym. It's been almost an year since I've not smoked and have lost 22 kgs working out.

I'm planning master's degree from Canada (I'm from India), but haven't been able to secure an admit yet. I'm assuming it is because of my low grades. I don't have a job. Having a 1 year gap already on resume is making me feel worthless. Every morning I wake up in the hope of getting that 1 email from Canadian Universities where I have been offered admission, but that day hasn't arrived yet and I'm still waiting. I have started to lose motivation and feeling like I'll relapse into the old me with all vices. I really don't know what to do!",A bad breakup and whole life looks fucked up now!,0

A little about my life currently, Recently after 2 years of working nights and coming home to try and study for college. I couldn't take it anymore, I quit a really good job at Amazon. Leaving me with a shitty options for jobs and my college put me on academic suspension. 

The working nights overall lead to me passing one class per semester with a 70(bare minimum). This was to me working full time hours yet doing full time online college.

"The last two years have been incredibly stressful for me. I’m a frontline healthcare worker who was dealing with the horrors of the pandemic on a daily basis. I took it all in stride and never saw what was coming my way. 

Around mid Jan (about 10 weeks ago) I started getting waves of exhaustion at work out of no where. I’m talking the type of exhaustion where I was basically paralyzed and had to lay down. One time I laid down on the floor at work because I had no other choice. 

The next week, I started having random chest pains on top of the exhaustion. At one point I thought I was having a heart attack and almost when to the hospital. I went to the doctors thinking I was having cardiac issues but everything checked out. I felt better…for a day or two…

Week 3 is when the real nightmare started. I started having intense anxiety (on top of the exhaustion). Multiple panic attacks a week. I couldn’t do anything without getting short of breath and my heart beating out of my chest. I was a complete mess at work and felt like I was going to collapse and die at any moment. Sometimes I was so physically stressed out I would go to the bathroom and lay on the bathroom floor. It was nuts. 

I called my doctor back and told him what was going on. I was reluctant to start meds but he talked me in to it. Said it doesn’t need to be forever and I can’t go on suffering like this. So I started a low dose SSRI. 

I also started therapy, took a week off from work and am doing much more self care. Like eating healthy and journaling. 

After about 6 weeks of hell, I’m feeling much better. I still have some anxiety here and there but for the most part, have returned to my baseline. I was convinced I’d never be the same again no matter what and I feel like it’s a miracle that I’m even functional now. 

Therapy has also been a huge help even though I was skeptical. It helped me understand that even though I felt blindsided by all of this, it really was building under the surface for a long time. 

Just wanted to say there is hope and don’t give up. I never thought that would happen to me and when it did, it was shocking. But things can get better!",Emerging for a nervous break down. There is hope.,0

"I just got home and im angry again. I got angry violently angry a couple of times earlier today. I am much happier when i spend time away from home. Much happier. But when i come home its like storm clouds gather and sends me to a state that I need an escape from. I don't drink smoke or do any drugs and under the conditions it is a miracle.

Also when i say angry, I never express it towards my mother. But her behavior pisses me off everyday and i have done nothing but treat her with the maximum level of respect and consideration. Instead of appreciating that and recognizing her behavior she instead chooses to exploit my empathy and bring stress drama and manipulation. I don't live for free at home. I pay in peace of mind.

"First post here. New to the gang. Really in a cloudy space. Bombarded with nonsense.

My mother and sister recently made fun of me for eating leftovers. I mean I waited until everybody got their share of food, and waited until the food had to be thrown away before I ate the scraps that were left over. How dare you hassle me over food, and stale left overs at that. So now I don’t eat!

My sister clogs the shower with her hair and my mother asks me why the drain is clogged. She asked me what did I pour down the drain. Like who the fuck pours shit down the shower drain? Every time my sister clogs the shower my mother assumes I did it. So now I don’t shower! Haven’t showered in months!

Recently my sister is cooking and spilled sauce and left meat all on the floor. My mother swore that it was me! She blamed me for days! She said that my sister wouldn’t/didn’t do that! It wasn’t until I showed her what was spilled was in the refrigerator still and was my sisters. So now I don’t even use the kitchen!

So, I don’t eat my moms shitty food, use the kitchen, or use the bathroom because she mocks me, teases me, and blames me for stuff!

My life used to be the shit. I was a million dollar ghostwriter on Bad Boy, Rocafella, Columbia and other labels. I did 5 years at a large university in NY, but I dropped out because my mom stole my tuition money my junior year

I’m trying to be cool and not spaz out and go through another psychosis. I’m bored, I’m lonely, I’m dirty, I’m poor, impoverished and consequently suicidal.

"I graduated with a masters degree and joined my place of work exactly a year ago. This is the first job of my life and that made it little difficult for me to get a hang of the corporate life. 
However, since I have a master's degree, the expectations were high. 

I made a lot of mistakes last year, one of which was that I didn't pursue good development work aggressively. Whenever a senior told me that they can not trust me with development work right now, I accepted it and hoped that they will see my efforts. 
The concerns of my senior was that I won't be able to understand development task by myself and even if someone explained it to me, I won't complete it before deadline because of my lack of skills. 

And because of this, a perception has been created in everyone's mind that I miss deadlines and that I only complete basic tasks. 

Since start of 2022, I have been trying my best to change the perception. I am taking on more tasks as well as completing them on time. However, if I make a single mistake, the views of my senior and manager changes to me being undependable. 

I am being micromanaged because no one trusts me that I can complete the work on time. 

And that's not it. I have also been given a warning of being put on improvement required.

"I think I may have burnout. This past semester, I’ve been juggling a lot more than I’m typically used too with 5 classes, a remote practicum and two additional jobs. I also have a horse I am responsible for and feel guilty I haven’t had the time to spend with him that he deserves (though he is well taken care of at a boarding facility). 

My practicum, in specific, has been a great deal of stress for me. Long story, but basically I was convinced to go into an area I have relatively little knowledge about and contrary to what I was told, discovered there was little to any support and structure. I’m a bit of a perfectionist so not knowing what to do has caused me great anxiety. Both my jobs can also be fast-paced and stressful, so I don’t get much of a break from the stress. In the past two months, my norm has been anxiety driven heart palpitations or absolute exhaustion. It has only gotten worse with time. 

I broke up with my bf in Jan due to having little time and besides him, all my friends have moved away. The only nearby support I really have is my parents. I love my mother, but she does not understand this kind of of mental burnout. I go to her because she has been a great sense of comfort over the years, but when I try and explain my burnout, she starts yelling and thinks I haven’t been working hard due to being in my room all day (misconception with remote learning, thinking computer = surfing the net) and otherwise being tired. Ultimately, this just makes me more stressed and the cycle continues. 

I really don’t know what to do at this point.

Cause: I had alot of stress from many things at the same time: friendships not going well (emotional stress), having to prevent friends from suicide (very exhausting), having way too much mandatory homework from university, depression(diagnosed) and more sources of stress

In short I had to deal with much more things than I could.

"So ive been masturbating for a few years and i started saving videos/photos to my phone so its easier to get to. I always keep them in the hidden section of my phone. Last night I forgot to hide them and I woke up and found them in the recently deleted section and other app I think she went through. The latest notification was 2 hours before I woke up, so I was certain my phone was turned on. 

The photos themselves were just photos and videos of girls I thought were really attractive (they were over 18) and would use to get off to. 

Now since they are in the recently deleted tab, notifications were only 2 hours old (and I had notifications from before 2 hours ago but before I went to sleep), I had apps open which I never use, and my phone wasnt in the spot I last had it.

So the title says “I think” because im just hoping it was me in my sleep and I was really tired, since some photos were perfectly fine and she hasnt said anything about it yet.

So incase she actually saw the photos/videos, can someone give me some advice on things like what to say/ do when or if she brings it up?",I think my mom found the explicit photos on my phone and I feel like throwing up.,0

"So in November 2021 I was with one of my friends at the elementary school near my house. We were messing around and we saw that this person's  backyard was connected to a piece of the woods near the school. We saw that she had a stack of rocks. I had the idea when I was with one of my other friends to knock them over but I didn't. This time we did. I can't remember if I did it or him, but I remember seeing the rocks collapse onto the ground. We ran and I didn't think much of it. I assumed they would pick it up and move on. It is now March. We had an assignment where we had to Photoshop a stack of rocks in one of my classes today. I sit near one of my friends that lives near me and knows everyone in the neighborhood and the general area. He said that they put those rocks up in honor of their dead father. I feel  terrible. Its not like I would do something like that now and it feels like I played a part in a traumatic experience in their life.

"Hello I'm currently in my third year of university. Since the start I have been very stressed and at times had bad thoughts come into my head. I tried to talk to my parents about switching programs or go to university with less expectations (The University I'm going to is known to be brutal to their students). Sadly that didn't work which I understand from my parents side if I get through it then it will pay off. The next two years for me is just going to be quite scary as I'll be doing a Full Time course load in the Fall, Spring and Summer for two years straight. Just ranting I guess and some sort of motivation would be nice honestly.

School for me has always been a stressful topic and has never changed even in high school I'd say I've always been so anxious or stressed about the topic. Though what I can say is that once I do the two years at least I am out and finish my degree and I can move on from the idea of school. Just ranting at this point as this topic has definitely affected me a lot through out the years but this week it has affected me more than ever but I am now coming into terms that with the two year plan I got going it's not going to be that bad forever.",University Degree Stress,0
"I really wish anyone can help me or i just wanna know if anyone is experiencing the same things i am because i havent found anyone who has. Im getting headaches/migraines every single day. Its been around 2 months now, this isnt the first time this has happened to me it happened 2 years ago same thing. I had migraines every single day non stop for like a year straight, to the point where i couldnt even eat and developed photophobia and couldtn even turn on my room lights or anything. So it eventually went away after a couple months but im back in here again. Doctors tell me that its stress/anxiety but it just doesnt make sense to me as to why it gets this bad to the point where i cant even get up from my bed or be awake for long hours before feeling pain, no one gets it this bad for this long, 7+ months NON Stop??? So it started around November with panic attacks and anxiety, usually something triggers my anxiety and i can control it, but no not this time it happens even when im happy out of nowhere i just feel bad all the time and super weak, then it progressed to me feeling okay in the morning and bad at night, i always knew id feel bad at night so i would do my daily duties during the day. Then it progressed even more to where i started getting my migraines/headaches every day and the light started triggering them. And now end of march im back in my room again lights off, headaches everyday, cant go out cant do anything, i can barely even be on my phone, lights all the way down and blue light off. I did notice though that it starts in my neck and shoulders and where my arms start on my back. I massage myself everyday, i try to take medications but they all give me extreme side effects even tylenol. I know itll be a few months before i get better, but i wish i knew more people that have gone thru this, i even tried magnesium gummies and got side effects from those as well.

"I am in my mid 30s and have just been given the chance to do an extra year and a half of study in a different University. The degree that I have was more theory based and I really need hands on experience to be employable in my field, which I now have the opportunity to do alongside guaranteed internships and portfolio work. 

My stress levels are currently through the roof about this, as I am worried that I won't be able to match the calibre of current high school leavers, who, even though treated as adults at University, still seem to have that high school mentality. My main issue is, even though not permanent, the dorm style accommodation and the fact that an ""old"" person is living with basically a teenager, although I did apply for a single room with a shared bathroom, so maybe not so bad. 

Usually I wouldn't have a problem with this, but already having experienced this with not much success, I am now stressing immensely. I'm not there to be anybody's friend, but the way I have been treated in the past, just for being a little older has been disgusting. There is not much available accommodation at all in the country, so looking for anything else is currently out.

"I wonder.. is it my stress, time management, or myself as a person in general that is blocking myself from doing the best I can? Or is it my anxiety and overthinking getting to me?

I am a F14 in my freshman year of high school, currently going through a roller coaster of thoughts and emotions. I'm trying really hard managing between piano, soccer, and my grades with school. I love everything equally, (well maybe except school..), but in the end, my grades are my priority over piano or soccer. I know that piano and soccer may benefit me throughout high school, but grades are more important. But that doesn't mean I'm going to give up on neither one. 

But here I am with a B- (84.5) in my history class, and I need to get it to an A- (90.1) by the end of my school final which is in about 2 months. Well I'll need an A- at least, so I could take AP Euro in my sophomore year, and it's only available in my sophomore year as well. AP Euro is definitely not a necessity for my next year in high school, but it'll benefit me a lot, and as my school is very tough and competitive, I want to achieve my goal and do it. My teacher is crazy strict, being 87 years old, he has his more ""older-fashioned"" and more ""understandable"" ways of grading. So I stress trying to fit into his perfect standards, but at the end of the day, I keep telling myself. In the future, there will always be people that will be wanting a perfect requirement that fits them. I will need to be able to be adjusting to those specific requirements, for the future, to benefit myself and my ideal career future and more.

I've never gotten a B, or a grade range in the B section (B-, B, or B+) throughout middle school and my first semester of high school until now. Is it the stress that's piling on me after all these hard schoolwork I'm not managing well or enough with my time that I have? My sleep schedule is actually horrid, I usually sleep at 2-4AM waking up at 6AM, with soccer practice 3-4 times a week (usually I skip at least 1 day a week since it's a little too much), and 2 lessons of piano a week. Also including the clubs I've decided to join, Mock Trials, which is now coming to an end with competitions. Volunteering, which I guess I could choose which days to help out.. but.. The homework. The load at my school is actually crazy, about 2-3 assignments new each period, which is every day, so in a week total about 30-40 assignments, which is quite a buttload. It's due either the following days, or sometimes, a miracle as it is it'll be due next week. But then again, there's at least 1-2 tests a week, which I need to study a lot for. Oh of course, there's also the projects and essays, let's add about 1 for every other week. 

Should I take a break from piano or soccer, and put my grades at my priority instead? I think I can be able to take my grade, 84.5% up to a 90.1% at least, which is \~6% of a percentage raise that I'll need to be okay. Telling my friends this, all I get in response is the same, ""It'll be okay."" All I wish these days is someone to tell me more than ""it'll be okay"". I'm still new to the environment of high school, and figuring out what fits for me, and what doesn't fit for me. Encouragement, something I haven't heard in awhile, is what I hope boosts me. Thanks for reading this far.

TLDR ; Not having the most decent grade in history class (84.5%), wanting to take AP Euro next year for my class, I need at least a 90.1% for my requirement to join the class. Struggling with the management of piano and soccer as well for my extracurricular activities, as well as school clubs, should I take a break from something? I need to put my grades before other stuff, including the fact to not freak out with studying and use time well. Also wish someone could tell me, I'm able to do it, and they have confidence in me.

"I'm 28. Had 6 dates in my life. Never had sex before. Had 1 bad acquaintance that I needed therapy to deal with.

I don't hate women. I don't think everything is pointless. I chat with coworkers, but I don't have a lot of friends. Ladies seem to think I'm a nice person and funny. I don't have much trouble shamelessly asking someone out. I've long thought I have enough hobbies and interests and goals to keep myself mentally stable and preoccupied. Doesn't stop everyone from saying I'm a sweet guy who just needs to be more confident, less sensitive, and wait for the right person.

I get flustered when I meet someone flirty or shameless, but I play it off with self-deprecation and wit.

I had a date with a coworker who was coming onto me frequently  (poking me, prodding me, talking about bodily functions, giving me looks and signs and thank yous, took my phone number, called me, wishes me morning, acts like she's out of breath around me, talks about and asks me sexual questions, talks about her dating history, etc).

She wanted to go to a Barne's and Noble's. I was 10 minutes late due to traffic and she'd shown up an hour early to give herself a headstart.

She stood next to me, I comically volunteered to be pack mule, and we sat and read books for a while, talking in-between. She made a spa appointment at 4pm. I asked her what she wanted - 1) friendship, 2) casual sex, 3) a relationship. I wasn't good for 2 (no confidence).

She described to me frequently about how much her previous relationships messed her up, we talked indirectly our thoughts about romance and such.

Her answer was 1 and she said she didn't know what the future hold.

We left and I went to a Chic-filet she'd informed me was there. Then I drove home rather than wait the hour for her appointment to finish, said I had fun, and drove home listening to Drowning Pool and Foo Fighters.

I got home, played a video game, laid down, and fought back tears feeling every insecure and negative thought I've had about myself. This date was something I wanted and it felt like I came away with less than I started with. She said she'd text me later and didn't get around to it until much later, and even though it was a short time I felt myself getting lonelier and madder because we just weren't having the initial flirty back and forth we did before the date.

I turned my phone off.

Everyone is going to tell me ""there's a million fish"" and she even said ""some people just don't vibe"" but the messages are just so unclear to me right now. This isn't too long after I broke up with someone who I felt like I did vibe with.

I just can't see myself continuing to give this much energy toward meeting someone new another 5-00 times like everybody else. I'm a sensitive person. I feel drained and hateful of everyone that dating comes so easily to even though I know that's wrong. I'm so mad we didn't click its embarassing, and I know it's not her fault. I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't feel like exercising or doing anything positive. I just want to be angry.

I guess I walked in expecting she'd throw herself at me, and I'd have the chance to be a gentleman and be like ""hey I like you, but I want to get to know you"" and she'd be like ""ah he's not just a desperate fuck, he has character."" And well that didn't happen. Instead I feel like I got read and told politely I wasn't what someone was looking for. And any attempt at friendship on my end will be a desperate act.

I could be entirely wrong. 

I would have liked if we'd hugged at the end or made additional plans. She agreed to doing something in the near future but I didn't get any excitement out of it. Optimistically I want to say we could probably be friends. Cynically I think she's not going to reach out and I spent an hour each way driving, took a day off of work for what I wanted to be a great date - I did all of that for nothing.

Of the 3 actual dates I've gone on after many years of rejection and indifference - the first didn't know how to tell me she wasn't interested and ghosted me for weeks, the second said sweet things about me but said she wasn't ready and was still healing from a previous relationship and said I need to be with someone who can do 50-50 in the relationship, and now this, where I felt someone coming onto me and tried to match it, and realizing at the end that I walked away in a toxic cloud of mental fog.

"so for context ive had an abusive dad growing up, and everyday living with him changed me. i feared getting yelled at for doing kid things, getting suffocated because i was crying. thinking about that now makes me mad of what i have to go through, but now i put that behind me. recently i’ve been stressed because of my bf and that internal problem just led up to more things, such as my purpose in life, who i want to be, and just self doubt. i feel like i’m not surrounding myself with the right people because i think they’re taking advantage of me, and are extremely careless to me. besides people, i’ve been feeling numb to the world. i feel like a robot and other peoples true self are showing a lot more. it feels like i’m high except.. i’m not high. the smaller things in my head stands out more like the noise outside my window. i’m usually not concentrated on that, but my brain picks it up more easily like i’m more aware of these things happening. my surroundings feels a lot different from usual. but i know myself when i’m completely normal versus when i’m out of it. there’s some people from reddit that told me i had an experience of depersonalization. i smoked before to get rid of some stress, and smoking mildly i know will not make me feel this way. the stress is overwhelming me and i feel trapped. but right now i had a vivid nightmare and it’s about the people in my real life. it affects me more and it’s the first time i’ve experience an actual nightmare. i usually don’t remember my dreams and i move past it, but this time it gave me a lot of stress, i remember the whole plot and context, the whole energy of it, and it’s scaring me.

"I've been planning my wedding that is happening in May of this year.

I got engaged a few months ago in January, and at first I felt fine with taking on everything but now it's starting to get into my head and I feel overwhelmed everyday.

My days consist of me working, wedding planning, and sleeping. Most of the time if i'm doing something other than that, I'm thinking of my wedding anyways. If I go shopping there's always something that will catch my eye and remind me of what I need to do or purchase for the big day.

Not only that, but my partner is in another country (LDR) and he can only do so much to help me with it all besides pay for things here and there. I live on my own while my partner lives at home (he's never been on his own before) and i'm struggling to pay for small things like a DJ or even cake.

I've tried talking to him about wedding stuff and he tends to get overwhelmed or be distracted with other things he's doing like gaming etc. Last night, I was talking to him about décor options we had and I showed him our ceremony space. It's on a terrace/large outdoor patio at this nice hotel in my city. I went personally to view the venue a week after we got engaged, sent him videos and photos, and he loved it too! Now when i showed him the photos last night he made a few ""not so happy"" faces and I almost started crying right there from the stress of it all. He kept saying ""I guess it'll have to do.."" and things like that. Felt like I screwed it up so bad.

I feel like a failure, that I picked a bad venue...and to top it all off I have a few people in my bridal party who are being really catty towards me now. They keep shitting on me for having ""bad communication"" even though I'm trying my best and have everything on MY shoulders. They haven't offered to do anything specific but constantly say ""I want to help in any way I can! Let me know what to do!"" and I have no clue what to ask them. Also, a bridesmaid of mine really dislikes my MOH and tries to make me feel like she's not doing ""enough"" and says she feels she's unsupportive.

I didn't even want a big wedding at a hotel. I originally imagined a wedding where I am married at a nice park, have dinner at a nice restaurant and then go to a pub for a beer after to celebrate.

The only reason it became a big wedding is because of my in laws and my family coming, plus a bunch of my friends wanted to go. My fiancé is only bringing 3 family members and none of HIS friends are going to come (despite travelling to Mexico for a wedding recently).

After all this, I can see why people elope or have really really small weddings.",Feel like everything thinks i'm annoying and I'm unhappy with how I never stand up for myself.,0

"Hi,

I’m a sales director who recently received a promotion to build and lead a new sales operation for an Australian media company in a foreign country. After relocating my family and settling into our new home, I found the job to be manageable, albeit stressful, for the first 8-9 months.

However, after a year, I've realized that the stress has become a part of my daily routine, and it's starting to change my personality. I'm experiencing burnout, feeling completely drained, unmotivated, and even depressed at times.

On one hand, the benefits of international experience, such as building and managing a team in a new market and exploring new commercial initiatives, are invaluable. On the other hand, the stress is taking its toll, and I'm not sure if it's worth it.

"Hi Reddit, I'm here to vent about my stress, and honestly, I have no one to talk to. I am F (23), and last year I started my first ""big girl job"" as a copywriter in marketing. I originally studied filmmaking to be a screenwriter or producer, anything to get me to be on set. My love and passion for being behind the scenes and seeing the projects come to life are breathtaking. I enjoy talking to the cast, getting behind the camera, and being transported to a different unique world. So why was my first big job in marketing? 

During the pandemic, my concern was how to get myself out there when I was very limited in making connections and unable to go out and shoot because of social distancing measures due to the pandemic. The school I was in offered an internship for a class in marketing, and I took it (honestly, anything to make my portfolio and resume look good). Not going to lie; the internship was fun and exciting, so when they offered me an entry-level position in marketing, I was hesitant. I didn't study marketing or advertising or anything related to that, just filmmaking. They knew that I only had knowledge of film but still wanted to give me a chance to explore my career options. Now, having been here for a year, I've built up an extreme amount of stress.

Every single day I am constantly feeling stressed, anxious, and depressed. I'm always messing up, and it has gotten to the point where I received a PIP. I saw it coming. 

I am struggling with my grammar, not being strong enough when it comes to presenting, and lacking creativity. Things are so rushed here that I often miss a thing or two, which reflects poorly on me. Being dyslexic doesn't help either. As a result, I received a PIP, and it has spiked my stress levels and anxiety to the point where I feel sick every day. I can't eat, don't feel like getting out of bed, can't breathe, can't sleep, and can't think clearly.

Additionally, I have been struggling with a yeast infection for six months (yes, you read that right). My doctor says I have a candida overgrowth, so I am on a strict diet in hopes of getting it under control.

The whole experience is making me feel like a failure, like I've made a big joke out of myself. My manager talked to me and said that copywriting marketing isn't for me because I didn't learn it, and he knows my skills lie elsewhere. I agree, but I am afraid I won't find a job in film with how the economy is and the difficult hiring process I see on social media. It's terrifying. How am I going to pay for school, debt, help my parents, pay for groceries for this stupid candida diet, and help my grandma in Mexico, and more bills?

My parents and a coworker of mine are giving me words of encouragement and saying that everything is going to be okay. They say I should still be proud because I tried something new, created a new set of skills, and toughened up. I don't know if that's true.",I can't stop thinking and I need to vent!!,0
"Sorry if this isn't appropriate for here, but the stress is killing me. I'm 24 and I feel like I've got the stress of a 45 year old going through a midlife crisis! 

Three weeks ago, I started up a new job with security, I got one 6 hour shift, and three 12 hour shifts. Honestly, I love this job despite the hours, and I can handle it. 

But, this past week? Everything feels like it fell apart. My sister popped over with her husband on a surprise visit ( haven't seen her in 14 years ) so it should've been exciting, but all it did was bring trouble to our already fragile household. She instigated drama with my father and everyone else, then her boyfriend was just causing problems with zero consequences. Then, two days later, my Uncle shows up and it's all great.. up until he hits me with news tonight that he's got cancer and he's trying to enjoy himself since he's scared of worse case scenario. All of this on top of family dilemmas with my father, seeing it affect my grandmother? ALL tied together with the very awkward sleep I get, I can just feel my mental health regressing back to incredibly old, toxic, unhealthy ways. I wanna smoke weed to ignore the stress and call off work, but I know doing all that will ruin any progress I've ever made. 

Oh, I'm also having allergies worse than ever so my nose is constantly dried up, in pain, slightly bleeding and my eyes itch like hell. I know I'm just yapping at this point, but good lord, it feels like way too much to stomach in such a short amount of time.

"One of the best ways to decrease how much total stress you experience is by adding good forms of stress (short and moderate) called hormetic stressors.  Cold water is a prototypical hormetic stressor.  It releases stress hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline but it is short and not extreme.   

We just launched an app that provides guided cold showers to make it easy for you to do them.  It is led by a Master Chief Navy SEAL.  We teach you a set of mental tools around tactical breathwort, body relaxation, self talk, etc.  These tools not only make cold showers easier but they also help you handle stress more generally.    

In fact, the best way to train yourself to handle stress better is to systematically stress yourself and then practice these tools while stressed.  If you do that, these tools will become reflexive any time your body generates stress hormones.

"Sometimes, it’s overwhelming to think about all the stressful things. When you let go of them, you can take solace in the fact they remain in a safe space, but no longer occupying headspace. I developed CocoonWeaver because of a dream I had. My dream was about an app that would be intuitive enough to release the many fleeting thoughts that occupy ones mind. Since then, it has been developed in to a working product, and improved with the help of kind feedback from various neurodivergent communities. I would love to take feedback from this community as well, if you have a moment to download the app and share your feedback I would be extremely grateful.

"I will admit that I’m a bit of a hypochondriac and have a lot of anxiety surrounding my health, but I’m experiencing something I’ve never gone through before. Since Sunday evening, my whole body has been in extreme pain and I just have that feeling I get when I’m sick with something like a cold or the flu. But those are my only symptoms. I’ve had 2 negative Covid tests and just got a negative flu test from the doctor where they also did some lab work and gave me a prescription for my pain. 

The only other explanation I can think of for the cause of this is that I got extremely depressed and stressed out last week. I’m not new to stress or depression though, and I’ve never had this type of reaction before.

Just wondered if anyone had any ideas or has experienced anything like this.  I’m worried this is all in my head even though my pain feels very real and severe, and it doesn’t seem to be letting up at all.",I’m In Pain,0
"I was wondering if someone recognizes the feelings I have sometimes because I feel like I am weird and alone. I've read about anxiety and think that's what I have... But there's so much info online that I do not know for sure.

I get minor panic attacks on random moments and I can not seem to find any reason why.  
The most recent example is when I was asked to go on a team meeting outside of working hours. I felt almost frightened and felt like I wanted to cry and life is too overwhelming for me. Another example is a party I recently went to, I was scared to go for about two weeks (even though my gf and a friend were with me). There was literally nothing bad about it, but I was stressed up until the moment I got there.

When I try to think of a reason why I'm feeling like that, I do not have a single clue. My life is good and I have everything I need/want but I keep looking for small things that make me feel unhappy and anxious. I can stay awake and panic/overthink over all kinds of small things like this. I just want to feel happy and stop overthinking constantly but I do not know how to do that.

"I work at an engineering firm that surveys underground utilities and drain systems. I started work last July and it has been a never ending stream of all consuming stress and anxiety for me. It feels like I can’t escape from work and it never ends, and it feels like no matter how hard I try my work always gets thrown back at me with my boss telling me it’s horribly wrong and that I had no idea what I was doing. It’s not like I don’t ask him for help either, he will review my work and offer revisions, only to go back and find new instances that he didn’t mention before. 
If all I had to do was draft I’d be okay with that. But because the company is so small everyone does every project on their own start to finish, from proposal to cost estimate to survey to drafting to finish. All I know how to do is draft, and because everyone has been so busy I haven’t been able to learn the other skills. 
I’ve also been given another near impossible task that I have been trying to teach myself how to do, but I also haven’t even had time in my work day to do that. 
Even my coworkers are all older than me by a significant margin, and have been in this business for quite some time. They live to work, and I don’t have anything in common in which forms camaraderie. 
Literally the only thing keeping me here is the pay. Which is very good, but I cant live like this. I feel exhausted and broken when I get home. I feel like I can’t do anything after.

"Whatever you’re trying to achieve - save the world, write a novel, devote yourself to a particular cause – there are likely to be those who will be critical. Some people just have a critical disposition while others will take issue with the specifics of your particular endeavour. Criticism is unavoidable. Your choice is in how to respond to it. 

### Consider these strategies for managing the critics in your life:

**Clarify your purpose.** As humans, we are compelled to make meaning. Making meaning for ourselves – and value for others – is fundamental to a life well lived. When you’re doing something very important to you, you care far less about the criticisms of others. If they can easily throw you off your path, you might want to reflect on how important it really is to you. Are you living your purpose consistent with you values?

**Understand the critic’s motivation.** Are they projecting themselves in to the situation – their aspirations, their skill set, their propensity for risk, their values? Are they genuinely trying to protect you from any potential down-sides? Are they trying to maintain the status quo – for you, them or both? Are they masking their own lack of action? 

**Recognise that criticism is not balanced appraisal.** We have evolved to notice negative issues more readily than positive ones. We are more likely to notice criticism than encouragement: people working against us over people supporting us. Most people are actually indifferent to you and your life so get on and live it.

**Realize that you’re going to be criticized no matter what you do.** Whether you become a billionaire, movie star, teacher, doctor, or sit on the couch all day, there is someone that will tell you that you’re doing the wrong thing. So, live your life building towards what you do want rather than what the critics don’t want.

**Respond calmly.** Rather than giving your critics the pleasure of an emotional response, respond kindly with a considered response. Acknowledge any leaps of faith you are making. 

**Use your critics as motivation.** While some people are intimidated and deflated by the critics of the world, others are able to use the negative comments as a source of motivation. Remind yourself that while the critics are standing on the sidelines, you are on the pitch and playing the game.

**Decide if they have something useful to say.** Some criticism may carry valid points – explore these with your critic and ask what their solution would be – the response differentiates between useful and harmful dialogue. If the criticism isn’t useful, move on. You have more important things to do.

**Take criticism as a compliment.** Most people will leave you alone if you’re struggling or aren’t doing anything noteworthy. You only become a significant target of negative comments if you’re doing well. If you’re taking a lot of heat, you must be doing something correct!

**Live your life without the need for the approval of others.** Live your own life, by your own values. Use your signature strengths to create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future in your chosen pursuit.

"Society expects us to have kids, house, nice car and a “successful” career to be “happy”.

We’re brainwashed into following this “dream” right from school and put ourselves through great deal of stress pain and suffering.

Unless you’re born into wealth you have to give your life away and work for someone else’s dream with the tales that one day you will have the same amount of wealth and along the way you’re reminded how far away you are and compare yourself to others that have just that bit more than you.

You sacrifice your life, freedom, health, relationship all for some pocket change and a supposed wealth while others are milking from your sacrifice this making you feel like a failure, feeling like that dream is further and further away.

It’s a mindset you need to teach yourself, a mindset where your head is clear and at every obstacle you need to tell yourself no matter what it is that you’ll be fine because LIFE IS TOO SHORT AND CAN CHANGE IN AN INSTANT and then when your health suffers all of these aspirations and dreams do not matter.

I’ve been incidentally diagnosed with cancer - was very lucky as they’ve cut it out fairly quickly, only 3 nights in hospital, painless procedure. I’ve won a lucky dip with life because it was nothing, but seeing people who care about me being so upset was a horrible experience.

I wanted them to be happy and stop worrying because I’ve never thought much of myself then why would they? Because I am nothing, I am not worth anything, low self esteem, never had any aspirations, goals, only liked cars, wasn’t very social, couldn’t really talk to people and sat in my own head alot.

Showing how much those close to me cared for me made me change. When I lay in hospital my head was clear, didn’t worry about work, buying a house, savings or career. Only my family mattered and that’s how I’ve learned this mindset and began adapting my life around it, got rid of as much finance as I could, paid off my phone, sold the BMW bought a cheap Fiat for cash. Financial freedom helped with not worrying about money. Began saving money for a deposit for my new house in the future.

I keep reminding myself to enjoy the little things in life, going for a walk, going to a gym or even buying something fancy to eat here and there on my weekly shop, going restaurant and getting a carbonara or a new phone case. I’ve started eating healthy and looking after my health. I feel happy, proud of myself and I live week by week.

Of course I am aware I am very lucky and not everyone has the same opportunities in life and do not wish to upset anyone by this post. I hope this helps someone to find their path in life.",I hope this makes you feel better,0

Study Title: Evaluation of a Persuasive Mobile Application for Prompting Time Management Behaviour  If you are a student (part-time or full-time) enrolled in a degree program in a higher education institution, 18 years or older, and able to access a smartphone device, you are invited to evaluate the effectiveness of a persuasive app. The app aims to persuade students to be more organized towards their tasks and study spaces.  

First, you will be asked to give consent to do the study and respond to pre-survey questions (take 20-25 mins), which consist of demographics questions, questions of your preference for organization toward your tasks and study space, level of perceived ability to control your time, and stress level. After answering the pre-survey questions and providing your email address, you will see a link to the app. By clicking the link, you will be able to download the app on your device.  

Second, you will use the app daily by adding your daily tasks and organizing them based on their importance/urgency, marking them as complete, and engaging in social community features over four weeks. The app will send you notifications to emphasize the benefits of adhering to organizational acts and encourage you to minimize physical clutter in order to create a better-organized study space.  

At the end of the study, you will be asked to respond to the post-survey questions (take 20-25 mins), which is the same pre-survey question, including your experiences and perceived persuasiveness towards the app. The interview will be optional. There will be a question that asks you if you want to be interviewed, and by choosing “yes,” the researcher will communicate with you for an online interview which takes 15 mins. The interview will be audio recorded.  

Your participation is highly appreciated and is completely voluntary. All data will be treated confidential and for research purposes only. You will not be asked for any personal information other than your email to connect the pre survey, post survey, and the app usage.

"Hey Reddit,

This is my first post so bare with me - but I'm lost and I can no longer see the light in life. I've been working a crap job for the past two and a half years where I've been overworked. On top of that, my team is beyond toxic and our VP has caused so many issues to the point half of the team left, and the ones who remain are hanging on a thread to the point some are going on stress leave.

I feel stuck. I'm dealing with issues personally, at home, and at work. 

I keep applying to jobs but nothing comes out of it. I've done so many interviews and made it through to the final round only to be told I was a strong candidate but they went ahead with someone else.

I feel lost and hopeless. I battled so much in my life and got through severe depression in my teens to early twenties and what kept pushing me then was the fact that I thought I'd create something out of myself. I thought my future would be better. But it's not. 

The days are getting harder and I'm not sure what to do or where to go or who to turn to. I feel heavy all the time. I'm a 28 year old loser who has a stagnant career and a toxic job, no relationships, nothing. I'm losing hope",I can't see the light anymore.,0

"I’ll try to cut my story short in hope of someone out there being able to help me and guide me as I feel like I can no longer continue living with this feeling.

A general idea about myself is that I am a 22 yrs old medical student. I usually stress and worry a lot about medical school and my examinations, regardless of the fact that I score the highest amongst my batch. 

My story starts the summer of 2021 where I met a girl that goes to the same medical school as I do. Half way through the relationship problems start to arise between the two of us and I didn’t think anything of them as all relationships have their ups and downs. At this time, my partner began to say bad and mean things to me when we fought which initially didn’t affect me as I knew it was because of her being angry (she also reassured me after the fight resolves that she didn’t mean it). This started to escalate in which the problems became more frequent and almost every time I’ve had hurtful things being said to me. This progressively increased till the summer of 2022 (~11 months past for our relationship) which was the same summer in which I would take my Step 1 exam (a really important, exhausting and dreadful exam). At this point I used to always worry about our future and if were are even compatible, I used to have a weird heart clenching feeling that is filled with worry and anxiety, I also used to wake up from sleep several times with my heart racing or wake up before my alarm with the thought of our relationship overwhelming. We had a fight around 3 weeks before my exam which was my last straw and I communicated to my partner at that time that I want to end things as I felt I should communicate to her my true feelings that I no longer feel like I can continue in this relationship or think we have a future together (the things that were said to me where the worse out of all fights). She was devastated, cried and begged for me to give her another chance as she will change herself. I was heistant but decided to give her a chance, it worked out for the first few days but then the same heart clenching weird anxious feeling returned. I tried to battle it and not disclose it to her, but eventually I couldn’t hide it anymore and told her I couldn’t accept and give her another chance (around ~4 days before my exam). The whole 4 days and holiday after the exam was devastating I was really sad and down. With time, I used to distract myself and go out with friends (I don’t drink) almost every other day which helped me try to forget the whole situation. 

Keep in mind that I’ve got several messages from my ex weeks after the breakup about how I was wrong and that she would never forgive me and other prayers. Similarly over the last couple of months (it’s been 6 months since our breakup) I’ve been getting tiktok reposts from her account of videos taking about injustice and how sad/devastated she was which always made me feel very guilty as I was the reason for her current feelings. Similarly, it made me self-conscious about my decisions and doubt my feelings as she claims I never loved her and if I did I would never leave her.

Fast forward to the last month (5 months since breakup) where I finally approached a girl in my class that was always getting my attention and I couldn’t lay my eyes off her. In the first 3 days (through text), I was very happy and excited to get to know her. Three days later (which was also when the new school year started and the week of my important sport tournament) I started to have this same tiring, coruscating and exhaustive heart clenching feeling as if there is something I am worrying about. It started to increase progressively and I’ve always tried to forget it and keep it in the back of my head,, but it has been really taking a toll on me as I almost wake up everyday with this feeling and it stays throughout the day. Keeping in mind that throughout this period we’ve grown really close and she seems to really care about me. I have this feeling in the background around 60% of the day, 20% is me being distracted by work and friends and the remainder 20% consist of me actually overthinking and worrying. I really don’t understand why is this happening:
	a. Am I feeling guilty that I am meeting a new person?
	b. Am I worrying that this new relationship may end like the previous one?
	c. Am I scarred and no longer can commit to a relationship? 
	d. Why is the same feeling (but less intensity) that I was having before I left my ex happening again????
	e. Is the person not compatible for me and I am still seeking my ex?
	f. Did I still not move on from my previous relationship (prior to the new girl I was certain that I did move on and had 0 feelings, but I brought it up now because I have 		no idea what is the reason for this feeling)

Any input can help me understand this feeling that is taking a huge toll on me.

"Thinking Bout seeing the doc just to get myself checked out. Could be old age or poor lifestyle habits but i recently had a panic(?) stress moment that lasted for at least 5minutes until a problem was solved

Background info: only experienced 2-3 occurrences where i found my legs specifically shaking due to nervousness. These experiences are spread very very far apart. 1st time over 10yrs ago fairly minor was just nervous about a new environment &amp; people. 

2nd time was last june 2022 was falling behind online class, thought i couldn’t get set up this program until teacher helped lol and i think this was the main cause of stress (fear of being unable to catch up? Lost?) also deep slow breathing didn’t work here. How to manage lmao

Most recent was few days ago, no leg shaking but just like the 2nd time can’t really think straight, brain wasn’t calming down even though i was breathing normally. Again it was a school related thing, had an IT issue i couldn’t fix, couldnt login to join lecture that was ongoing at the time. Feared missing out important content until i remembered i can watch the recording later but didn’t really get rid of that unpleasant rushed feeling and anxiousness that i need to get this login resolved. Only until i got connected with the school IT helpdesk that i felt completely fine again

I seldom get nervous in job interviews but what is this??? Not sure why my body reacting like this if it’s just fear of falling behind/missing out

3. **Practice self-care:** Take care of your physical and mental health by getting enough sleep, exercising, and eating well.
4. **Seek support:** Talk to friends, family, or colleagues about your stress or consider seeking professional help.
5. **Practice mindfulness:** Take a few moments to focus on your breathing or meditate to help reduce stress and increase focus.

"Before anyone asks, no, the problem is not coming from my supervisor. He’s kind, willing to help and available for me. 

If you ask me I wouldn’t even say that I feel stressed before the meetings, in the sense that I’m not overthinking, I’m not having this bowl of stress in my belly that one could have facing pressure. 

Yet I don’t know why, systematically, 10-5 minutes before the meeting, I go to the toilet and I throw up everything I have, even if I had a light breakfast before. I really don’t know what can I do to stop this because it doesn’t feel like the problem is coming from me. It feels like I have no other choice but to throw up. 

Obviously it’s linked to the fact that I’m going to apply to a PhD and the fact that he’s a very knowledgeable man in his field, and there’s probably a bit of impostor syndrome playing. But what’s worrying me is the fact that of all the 10-12 meetings we had so far, I systematically throw up. I’ve had other meetings with other supervisors when I was a research assistant for instance and it didn’t happen probably because the stakes are lower.

"In my work as a hypnotherapist most of my clients are mature adults experiencing issues rooted in anger, anxiety, depression - or a mixture of these. Often, they are wondering if their present issues are linked to their childhood experiences. More often than not, the answer is yes. 

Research carried out since the end of the last century has led to a greater understanding of how adverse childhood experiences impact on long term wellbeing – both physical and psychological. The key findings are:

· Childhood trauma is very common: even in so-called well-to-do areas.

· There is a direct link between childhood trauma and chronic disease in adulthood.

· The more types of trauma a child experiences, the greater the risk of them of experiencing social and emotional problems as adults.

· Those who experience childhood trauma often experience more than one type of trauma.

You can calculate your own ACEs score by responding to the following questions. Give yourself 1 point for each question where you experienced that category of trauma before your eighteenth birthday. 

1. Emotional abuse: Did a parent or other adult often or very often insult, demean, belittle, humiliate, verbally assault, or threaten to physically assault You? 

2. Physical abuse: Did a parent or other adult often or very often grab, slap, push, or hit You? 

3. Sexual abuse: Did a parent, adult, or someone at least five years older than you ever touch your body in a sexual way or attempt or have oral, anal, or vaginal intercourse with You? 

4. Emotional neglect: Did You often or very often feel that no one in your family loved you or thought you were important; or your family did not look out for each other, feel close to each other, and support each other? 

5. Physical neglect: Did You often not have enough to eat, had to wear dirty clothes, had no one to attend to your medical and dental needs, or had no one to protect you? 

6. Loss of parent: Were your parents separated or divorced, or did you lose a parent for any reason? 

7. Domestic violence: Did You often or very often witness or hear violence between your parents or other adults where someone was being grabbed, shoved, slapped, hit, kicked, had something thrown a them, sexually attacked, or threatened with a weapon? 

8. Family member with addiction: Did You live with anyone who was a problem drinker or alcoholic, who used illicit drugs, or who was addicted to any other substances? 

9. Family member with depression/mental illness: Did you live with anyone who was depressed or mentally ill, attempted or committed self-harm and/or suicide, or hospitalized for mental illness? 

10. Family member incarcerated: Did you live with anyone who went to prison? 

ACES Score (0-10) = 

As ACE scores increase, so does the risk of disease, social and emotional problems. With an ACE score of four or more, things start getting serious. While studies in different locations return slightly different results, the figures suggest around 11% of the population have experienced four or more adverse childhood experiences.  

Fortunately, brains and lives are somewhat plastic. Resilience research shows that the appropriate integration of resilience factors — such as asking for help, developing trusting relationships, forming a positive attitude, listening to feelings — can help people improve their lives. Research in to post traumatic growth has identified five broad areas of growth:

· greater appreciation of life,

"I'm moving interstate in 2 weeks, have had a lot happen in my life over the past 4 months, zero support where I currently live and I'm under extreme stress that's destroyed my appetite completely. I eat maybe a few bites of food most days, rarely eating a proper meal. I'm not even doing my usual stress binge eating, nor are my chocolate cravings there. I just feel full or sick every time I try eat. I'm losing weight rapidly that I can't afford to lose (I'm very short and already had a small frame so even just 3kg is a huge loss for me, anymore and I'll look like a ghost)

Most of my stressors will leave me when the move itself happens and I'm seeing a new therapist as well then, one better equipped to help me.

I just need help with eating in the meantime. I can barely stomach anything, when I do try eat a meal, I'm done after a few bites. I have very little control at the moment and I want to do right to my body to reduce the impact of this stress. All I can really control are food, making sure I take my medication and get some extra sleep. I just need help or advice with the food part.

"Hello all.

I have been on sick leave from work for 3 months now. 
Tomorrow I’m starting slowly again. 3 hours. 

Throughout all January I have had this persistent restlessness. I have been sleeping 4-6 hours every night, woken up, and slept again for 2-4 hours. Getting up at noon. The past two weeks I have tried to get up at 8, to match my work schedule. Now I only sleep 6 hours and stay in bed trying to get in the last two hours. 
It worries me that I’m still not sleeping through a full night.
I’m not sure if it’s stress or my hiatal hernia or my chronic neck pain that wakes me up. But I wake up rather abruptly. So I’m guessing stress. Sometimes I wake up with racing heart.

Speaking of racing heart - I started to get that randomly racing heart throughout the day. I wonder if it’s because I’m starting work and I’m nervous about it. I have social anxiety and I’m trying to fit into this new “me first” mindset. I’m a big people pleaser, but I have had to break with that habit now. Also I keep getting chest pain, I’m not sure if it’s my hiatal hernia or if it’s stress.

Idk what to do. I’m feeling uneasy about not feeling better than I am after 3 months.","Sleeping 6 hours, heart Racing and chest pain",0

"TLDR : 3 questions at end regarding how to not care to disappoint when team and boss have seen my abilities. Boss has high aspirations for me this year or which if I fulfill I’m going to stretch myself so thin that I will leave or go into depression.


I was given a rather good yearly review, and well incentivized, but I am currently stressed, and trying to figure out how to have less responsibilities, when it’s desired I have more. This is above and beyond the rest of my team.

Boss sees my “potential” and not only wants it to continue, but also have me lead more, be more of a driver and influencer, and upgrade my knowledge, cross-team visibility. All of which I do not want. Taking on any more work feels like I’m going to “pop” and I’m already near / at burnout.

I hate disappointing and failing (why I try harder than others on my team; and also why I’m hate being in this position I am right now) but I’m at my max currently near / in burnout, thinking or ways to get out. My mindset is that I’d rather quit a 6fig job and go elsewhere / take a break than disappoint and fail someone whom believes in me so wholeheartedly, and knows how fast I can operate.

Sadly I’ve “shown my hand” this past year of what I’m capable of, but it’s unsustainable for my stress levels, needed downtime, and resetting ability. And more is desired. I’ve mentioned already to the boss that I’m burning the candle at both ends, but it’s only been sprinkled throughout the year. I also hate that I would them regret providing a large optional incentivized reward. Additionally if I fail it’s most likely no more of that and I would just be considered “middle of the road”. I’m OK with that if someone didn’t know my abilities, but again I have pushed past 120% capacity many times for tight deadlines and to get things done.

- How do I change my mindset to not care about disappointing 
- What, if anything, do I tell boss? I feel I need to drop hints that this is too much and if I’m dead it does no one good. ( absolutely sucks feeling capable but also having a hapicapied weakness of stress leading to depression.)

"Hi all, thank you for stumbling upon this post. 

The fall semester ended for me in mid-December, and I resume for the spring semester in a week. I'm reflecting on the time I spent while having absolutely no academic, social, or financial responsibility... to say the very least, I'm not very pleased with how I dedicated my time. Much of it was spent sleeping, binge-watching shows, cooking, and staying inside. I did get some important things done, but I can't help but think, ""why couldn't I have done more?"" I had hoped to do some exploring or go out more frequently to enjoy the outdoors. I'm disappointed in myself for not doing so.

At the same time, I'm reminding myself that I needed to not do anything for a whole month after a year and a half of consecutive working. This was my first break in a really long time. I'm just upset about how unwisely I spent it... I don't know.

This year I made sure to apply for many different scholarship and have managed to secure partial funding at least so it seemed like everything was looking up for me! 

Then last month my laptop was stolen (really scary situation that I’m not gonna into detail about) and I’ve had to email the university using my cell phone instead of my laptop like usual. I realized I’ve been sending draft emails through to the admissions office and associate prof while I was trying to save them and I genuinely just want to cry and give up. 

It’s such a stupid mistake and given the lack of response on the professor’s part I’m thinking this might ruin my chances. I was so proud of my personal statement and had really solid references but now I’m doubting everything about my application and myself.

I have got a girlfriend recently its been like 5 months and we meet in person twice or thrice in a month, and I met her yesterday too, when I am with her I pretty much enjoy everything, the feeling of hugging her, kissing her, and just doing stupid things together, but as soon as I drop her home its like all the memories just fade away, right after I drop her home I forget the feeling of huggin her, kissing her. I usually took this for granted all the time but yesterday after dropping her at her home tears started coming out of my eyes because of how much I hated this.

"I’m dealing with a really bad gut situation . Im only 29 but over the summer I was on a 2 month long holiday eating crap and that’s when my stomach problems started. I had blood on my stool at the end of two months and instead of treating it as a hemmoroid because of crap food I’ve been thinking I have colon cancer. Cut to the next 6 months of constant stress and anxiety and nausea and gut issues. I’ve never got constipated in my life before so I’m stressed about colon cancer and this is making me feel even more worried. 

I’ve been to the doctor and he told me the blood may be due to some minor rectal irritation but nothing to worry about. He didn’t check me physically though. 

All my blood tests and stomach ultrasound is clear but I can’t get over the thought of having colon cancer as whenever I’m constipated there’s been blood. 

I’m an extreme hypochondriac and im going through one of the most stressful times of my life and im worried I have colon cancer twenty four seven. Im constantly naseous and I have cramps. My stomach hasn’t been the same in 7 months and I never had this problem earlier.

They have no idea how to move forward in the future, I’ve had back to back 4 traumatic relationships where I feel like I’ve only been dumped because of the troubles my dad is facing and no one wants to be a part of this kind of a family. I’ve had men enter my lives, totally support me and fly away with all my trust broken back to back and all of this has broken me. I also saw my best friend pass away in a freak fire accident 3 years ago. All my friends are married / getting married and I feel constantly alone and sad. I can’t cope 
I run my own company and I’m independent enough to live my life currently - but there’s no security for the future and I’m just constantly feeling like I’m racing with time to make ends meet. I feel like no one understands the place I am in physically and mentally and my physical health is making me unable to work mentally - and if I don’t work I won’t be able to sustain myself. 

I used to be a go getter- constantly at the gym and now I struggle to get out of bed. I have no answers on what’s happening to me .

The last time I saw fresh blood was in JULY and now again In December. It’s fresh and very little but enough to make my mind spiral and think I’m dying/ I can’t switch off my brain and I’m constantly burning - farting and have reflux too! 

Do you think stress / anxiety are making my symptoms worse? I love to drink and I can’t even touch a drink thinking my stomach will spasm and bleed which makes me even more nervous and anxious.

"UPDATE IN COMMENTS: I’m a college student from out of state. I left home because I didn’t like the environment I was in, and being out of state was one of the best options. I don’t have a car and it’s mostly a public transportation type place so it’s not the biggest issue. I don’t ask people for rides unless I really need them. If we go out, I’ll tell them we can take the bus. On rare occasions if I need it I’ll ask for a ride. I was getting close to someone and only then did I ask them to take me to target twice, once we went, the other we didn’t and the second time I really needed to go for a project. So you kinda get the jist of it. When I need to go to and from the airport I has rely on others, this is one are I need help in because Ubers are so expensive (also I only need it after and before the winter, summer, and one thanksgiving break). I generally don’t care too much about it’s safety because I feel it’s generally safe, but this one time it’s kind of an issue. 

I also would like to mention that I don’t really have friends in school. 

Anyways, I ended up contacting many MANY people. They all basically said no. The flight would come in at around 12 AM and none of them could pick me up. I honestly got angry. My thought process was that I’m literally in a bad situation, I need a ride, and no one can either wake up or cut their plans short? It honestly just made me so frustrated. I get im not your best friend, but a girl taking an Uber at 12AM-1AM isn’t okay for many. I’m not the type to go out a lot so it’s uncomfortable for me. 

I get it’s late at night, but it just made me feel like people are selfish. I hope I never treat others the way I feel when I ask others for a ride. Because it feels terrible, and I’m not saying these people are the exact reason why I feel this way. I’m sure it’s an accumulation, but it just feels so terrible. 

I hate having to beg and pry and ask. I hate asking for a ride so I do try my best to get there myself. I even offer to pay because I don’t want people to do it for free and then me feel like I’m always bothering them.

I don’t know what to do, I know I’m emotional about this but people who have cars and give others a ride should try and be more empathetic to those who don’t.",To those who give car rides,0

"So last year, I went to a diner with my gf and I had myself a cappuccino for the first time. I've never tasted anything so delicious and I made it a goal to learn how to go about making one. After Christmas, I got myself an espresso machine. It would be a few months before I used it (lack of space where I live) but I finally got it set up back in November. My first drink, well... I never used a steam wand before. I watched some YouTube videos, my second cup was EXACTLY like what I had at that diner. Now I make about 3 cups a week or so (usually to keep warm more than anything) and it's expanding to where I got a coffee grinder so I'm not restricted by grind. If I want whole beans, I can work with them now. If I'm unsure what grind the bag I have is, pour some in the grinder to make sure.

Was it expensive? Well, getting everything together was about $260. With all the payment apps out there, it's affordable. You can make tons of stuff too. Lattes, mochas, I'll make hot chocolate with this thing. And I love it. If I have guests, I always offer to make them something. I found zen in the process, satisfaction in these product, and a desire to expand on what I know. It really makes me feel better knowing I can make something that not only I can enjoy, but friends and family can as well.

My advice? Learn a craft that you enjoy. If you like painting or even coloring, there's plenty of resources. If you like writing, maybe get a voice recorder for story ideas that pop up and expand on that for a bit. If you like food, all kinds of classes out there. But all in all, make something for you first.",Stress Relief in Making Things,0

Personality is defined as the collection of behavior, attitude, and ways of expressing emotions that makes a person unique. We can identify if a person is with a good personality or not based on the outer expression of inner feelings. If you want to become a better and successful person in life, be it professional or personal, building up on personality is a good place to start.

Only meds I've tried is low grade anxiety meds. And I'm unsure what bloods. My doc ran more thursday, said he'd call if anything was different. They tested for that one thing that starts with a T that checks for damage in the heart or recent HA's. 
And during the echocardiogram my Hr was 130. She noted it was fast but then 2 weeks later I get a call. Holter didn't show anything super concerning and the echo was fine. I am under tons of anxiety and stress but whatever is going on has had me bed ridden with neck pain, dizziness, headaches and heart discomfort . The fast HR and pounding feeling for literally months essentially with no breaks. My entire life has been Halted because I can't do anything. I take a shower and my heart goes a million miles an hour and my blood pressure goes to the 140's over 90. Brain fog and dizziness. Tinnitus like crazy and this weird whooshing sound and pain from my neck .
It all started with going to the doctor bc I had Thunderclap headaches after orgasm, which lasted everytime for 2 weeks then just stopped. Then I started feeling worse and that stopped but all this started. I've had an echocardiogram, several EKGs from the ER visits, an MRI 3 months ago no contrast, a CT with contrast of my chest and neck last month, a CT with contrast of my head last week. Noone can find anything. Only suggestion my doc had Thursday was potentially ICP and he looked worri3d that's what it was and said if I get a headache go to the er. Which I did 2 days ago to which they didn't do bloodwork but they did a CT and Xray . Tested my eye movement . Then gave me a shot and sent me home. 
I obviously need to continue to see my doctor and will. Just 4 months of this I'm trying to reach out for things to recommend to my doctor to test for and try because they're struggling hard. The only things I can even think of personally anymore is craniocervical instability, anxiety, and maybe clogged artery issues. With the ICP he thought, which is phesable I have 95 percent of the symptoms but the numerous head CTs and the MRI showing no pressure(doesn't rule it out) and the fact that it's been 4 months since it all began and I've not stroked out or anything makes it seem not entirely sure for me personally.
