I try to refill and stay on my medication but there's always an issue between cvs and my drs.office regarding some of my medications. The Dr office will say I have a refill in and then I'll go to CVS and they will say it's awaiting prescriber response and it can only be refilled with the drs approval. (it's Depakote) then I call back the Dr and they say no it's in there but they will call and NOTHING ever gets done. This has resulted in me multiple times being out of my medication when I need it overnight and now I'm up at 4 am. Listen I have to work tomorrow! I have a life. I can't just be up at 4 am feeling all weird and not being able to sleep. Should I change Drs or what??? Pissed off,I'm so tired of being bipolar for the medication factor alone.,2
"Edit: Should have put MIXED in title. During mania - we need sex to straighten out sometimes. 

I’m on the end swing out of a mixed which has lasted about ten days. I wasn’t in psychosis or anything extreme. I’m not off my meds so it wasn’t super dramatic or anything. Worst thing I did was throw a cheeseburger into the sink when I got some bad news about my dog. 

So, we had sex last night and afterwards when we were cuddling in bed he kissed me and said “I’m so glad you’re back. I missed you.” 

We chatted a bit more and he said he’s been dodging my sexual advances because I wasn’t feeling like myself and he felt wrong about pursuing anything sexual when I wasn’t my exact self. 

I hadn’t really put it together. I don’t think I’ve ever been so respected in my life.  How does everyone else’s SO handle sex in mania or mixed?",Bf won’t have sex if I’m in mania,2
"I've been hypomanic for the last 3 weeks. I'm medicated and I'm teetotal etc so it was relatively minor. But fuck me does the depression hit me like a ton of bricks. It's more physical than mental at first. My limbs get heavy. I have zero energy to get up and do simple things. I procrastinate. Skip a few meals. Not brush my teeth. Leave a chore that needs doing. Then in a few days I'll feel all the mental affects coming in. If I'm lucky I'll just be comatose for a month. But if a mixed state comes along then it's panic attacks, anxiety, despair and suicidal ideation. Fingers crossed it's just depression.

The hypomania was alright this time around. I have spent a bit too much, worked a bit too hard, overshared a bit too much, socialised a bit too much. But no real damage this time. It was intense but kind of pleasant. But I can feel the dip is going to be huge. This is anecdotal but it feels like if my mania is under control (no psychosis and no mixed state) the depression part is deeper. Feel kind of quietly melancholic on an epic scale. If that makes any sense.

It's going to be a slog for the next month. I should be happy I've got things under control I suppose. Anyone else want to share their experiences coming out of mania? It would make me feel better to hear others going through and surviving similar.",I'm coming out of a hypomanic episode and need to talk about it.,2

"I have confidence in my ability to take care of myself. I have been hospitalized twice and it was my decision both times. 

Now it’s a concern on whether I’m capable of moving out of my parents’ house. I’m a grown woman. I have a corporate job. I go to therapy. I go to groups. I take my meds. I have hobbies. 

Worrying is not the same as caring.",today I cried in therapy because I’m tired of people worrying about me.,2
"I've been so good about always taking my meds when I'm supposed to since I started treatment, but for the past few months I just can't seem to remember to take them like I'm supposed to. On top on that, I've gained so much weight since being on them and I'm just so fucking tired all day, every day. 

I'm just so over it all. Like everything. I haven't worked in like three years because I'll lose my insurance if I can even manage to find something I'm able to do. My only support system that understands what it's like (they have bp2) doesn't give a shit about me anymore so there goes that too. Getting to a breaking point and I'm scared.

Just needed to vent.",I keep missing my meds and honestly don't think I care anymore,2
"I haven’t had a full time therapist since I was 14, I am 35 about to be 36 in a month. I am scared, I was honest with her and told her my issues with therapy and meds as a child. I flat out told her about some of the suicidal ideation and that I am never going to go through with hit fir collateral emotional damage reasons to loved ones. I also told her that I don’t trust therapists and the reason I have avoided going is I am afraid someone would overreact to my dark thoughts. 

Anyway. Wish me luck. Next visit is second week of April.",So I got a Therapist…,2
"Then at least there'd be a hope of getting cured and resuming a mostly normal life. If I knew I just needed to push through the next few years of misery, and then it would be over one way or another, then I think I could do it. And if I did end up dying, at least it would be out of my control. No one judges or blames a person who dies of cancer. No one judges someone for dropping out of life completely to go through chemo. No one blames themselves for their kid dying of cancer. People have so much compassion and sympathy for people with cancer. Why is it that the same compassion isn't extended to people with incurable, lifelong, crippling mental illness? Why does someone's pain have to be cosmetically obvious for people to care, or even believe it's real?

I talked about this with my mom, who barely survived her own cancer, and she agreed with me without hesitation. I at least feel grateful to have family that can understand and support me, a luxury I know many of us don't have.",I'd rather have cancer,2
"Hello all , I’m new here but I feel like I shouldn’t be lol 
Yesterday was kind of a mental health day as I was talking to a social worker who was helping me find a new therapist. Long story short we got into my previous diagnosis’ and I told her mild depression , adhd and anxiety. Yes these are true but however the one that is relevant to this post that popped up that I didn’t know was bipolar. I end up contacting my previous psychiatrist because I did not recall him saying this ( I swear he didn’t ) and he said yes but it is unspecified. He diagnosed me because of my constant irritability and made a point to say today I may be in remission because I wasn’t as snappy as before. I honestly Just thought the things he would say would rub me the wrong way. Next week he’ll do a full evaluation. 

A few years back another therapist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder I forgot which , but I remember her say something of me being manic. I honestly don’t think she’s working anymore but I wanted this evaluation at the time because I believed I was bipolar starting around 13-16 years old. I had my reasons for it. Fast forward to last year my last psychologist said I was misdiagnosed and it was just adhd/add. I had mentioned my sex drive/hyper sexuality (which I may speak on in another post), my impulsive urges to do things, mood swings that can be intense, etc etc she said it was just a mixture of my depression and adhd. 
So now here I am, and thinking back to the things I’ve done before and do now. These things I am trying to control and make sense of mainly the hyper sexuality I started to wonder if I was just a sex addict because of my habits and started looking into help to stop these things but yet my only problem is when I’m in the mood lol. 
I’m at a point in life where I want a second opinion, or I just don’t want to believe or say I am even though I have the signs more than I’ve even mentioned.","Rant but not really,newly diagnosed but then again I’m not",2
"I've been involuntarily hospitalized once and it saved my life. It was something I needed at the time. However, following my diagnosis, I worry that family members will use it against me if I'm acting in a way they don't approve of. I'm worried they'll tell police officers I'm ""mentally ill"" and that I'll be handcuffed and forcibly hospitalized. Is this fear realistic?",Do you live in fear of being involuntarily hospitalized?,2
"Long story short, I was diagnosed with depression back in 2021 after a rough year and 2 failed suicide attempts December 2021. Physically and mentally I made a full recovery by May 2022, my ex of 7 years cheated on me in June and I surprisingly dealt with it really well. I’d been off work March-September due to factors outside my control which was stressful but again, I dealt with it well. I returned to work and on one of my first days back the most beautiful woman I had ever seen walked into the office. I’m a confident bloke but I was nervous AF! I spoke to her for a bit and thought there would be no way she would like me, fast forward a few hours later and she’d requested to follow me on instagram and we got chatting. We met shortly after for a date and it was like we’d know each other years, best date ever. From this point we both took it slow and just let things happen naturally. The connection we had was unlike any other and for both of us to feel the same was just unreal. I asked her to be my girlfriend in October and she was genuinely excited about it, this made me realise I’d found someone special. Shortly after this I had a serious family emergency and that was ongoing till January, she was my rock, my guardian angel throughout this whole ordeal. I’m 29 and I’ve cared for people a lot in relationships but never been in love despite them all being long term. I thought I was incapable but this woman changed that and she’s the first I’ve ever loved, and hopefully the last. On 02/01/23 the family emergency situation came to a close with expected but still devastated news. From this day on my mental health started to deteriorate but predictably, nothing too rapid. 05/01/23 I went over to my Nan’s house late at night after work to drop a birthday card off for her birthday the following day. I walked in to find her dead on the kitchen floor, this was the day I deteriorated rapidly. I needed my girlfriend desperately for support but I was just far too much to deal with. I wasn’t just depressed, this time it was different. I was awake 4-8 days regularly and would only sleep when I’d black out. I was exhausted but completely and utterly hyper fixated on anything that came into my head. Because it was my girlfriend who had become distant I stupidly bombarded her with messages begging for help and reminding her how much I love her. She wasn’t leaving me she just needed space and I could cope on my own. 20/02/23 2 men tried to steal my car and I managed to keep the car and defend myself but suffered some bad injuries in the process. I was hit 11 times with a knuckle duster and 40+ times by the other bloke with just his fists. I was left with 4 skull fractures, fractured orbital bone, broken nose and broke jaw. I’m an ex professional Muay Thai fighter so I’m used to a certain level of pain and discomfort but this was different, although I now have slurred speech, blind in my right eye and have lost substantial weight this hurt me mentally. I started to have panic attacks and I was going through episodes of what can only be described as mania and borderline psychosis. Again I continued begging my girlfriend for help and pushed her even further away, shortly after this she ended things. She made the right decision because I was horrendous and I was dragging her down. This present day I’m on the mend now and I barely remember any of it, the days all merged as one. It feels like someone else has been living/wrecking my life and last week I woke up and have been given it back. I’m now trying to fix all the damage I’ve caused, I’ve lost most of my friends, family and the love of my life. I’ll never give up on her but for now I can only love her from a distance. I hope one day soon she forgives me and wants to speak again but I also need to get some advice if anyone has experienced this before. I’ve spoke to numerous Dr’s in and outside the hospital but have just been dismissed as I struggle explaining it and play it down.

"I’ve always taken them all at once along with my multivitamin and didn’t know so many people took them one by one. That seems so time consuming, especially when you have ten or more to take. I just put water in my mouth, lean back and let it sit in the back of my throat, toss the pills in, open my throat to swallow then drink some more water. Been doing that for over twenty years and never had any issues and never got any of them on my tongue with the nasty taste I hear about.

"Or went voluntarily ig. I didn’t. I felt like I was treated like a criminal I felt so violated. I wasn’t overweight I was fit at the time but it still felt so degrading. I remember liking how I looked as I took off my clothes and stood there. They just got all giggly and excited and said “ooh a blonde!“.  After I literally hated my body I felt like it took everything sexual away from my body sorry tmi. I didn’t eat for 3 days after then binged on the worst hospital food. I wish I said no. It literally affected me a lot more than it should have but it was a week after I turned 18 so like it just felt weird to me. The age isn’t important it can feel weird to anyone idk im being salty.

I think about it less now tho which is good. Sorry I sound soooo grouchy I think everyone had to go thru this as well. Right?",Did everyone else get strip searched when they were sent to the mental hospital?,2
"Hi everyone! 

I have a question that has been occupying my mind for a long time, and I hope that this will spark a discussion and we can get deeper into understanding bipolar and find some answers. Maybe some of you are wondering the same.

The question: mostly during manic episodes when my mind is racing at an alarming pace I wonder if this is all caused after all by external factors that make me stressed out OR by the bipolar itself, so from within. Like, I'm starting to stress out because a situation occurs that is out of my control: turmoil in a relationship, some annoying interactions, things at work etc. Or I start stressing out because of a shift towards manic?

 This is where I'm lost: at times I think that because of the diagnosis I overthink the stress and anxious feelings; knowing and convinced about my diagnosis i fully inserted bipolar behavior into my own identity and it informs my actions? But we don't live in a sterile bubble, life is life and always something is happening.


For context: 
during my manic state I start pacing, mind racing, increaced heart rate, twitches and intrusive thoughts. I start walking fast through streets almost running away from this, and I end up looking into passerbys eyes and then it's as if I'm being thrown into their lives, as if I live through their experience, I imagine how they act, what happened in their childhood, flashes into their daily routine, interactions, frustrations and happiness. And then I look at a window on some far away building, start imagining and experiencing the life of another person in a similar way.
 Then I get thrown back into my body into reality and become more overwhelmed. Then it's my own memories of the past, then imagining my own future and so on. 

 
The experience is intense and doesn't stop. When it wears off eventually I regain focus, calm and ability to think clearer. Happens periodically about every few months and lasts usually about a week, maybe 2(depending how I deal with it after the peak. It's not the most intense that happened but I don't wanna go in even more details, because this is already TL;DR 

Edit: I have been diagnosed by 4different doctors on 4 separate occasions, and rejected that idea for about 7 years until it became too unbearable and I was legit worried that this time I'm definitely not making it through. 


So let's discuss the initial question! Would love to hear your thoughts about this chicken or the egg question and gain some insights!",Chicken or the egg? discussion!,2
"Based upon recent memes I made the 200% upgrade to my ADHD, which is now known as AD4K. This choice has been sponsored by my good friends hypomania and anxiety. Also I would like to thank my good friend and worst enemy caffeine addiction. 

No focus. Brain go woooooo.

Anxiety is super overwhelming, sensory input is cranked up, and so are my emotions. This is the worst feeling ever! I love it! 

Later today I think I'm gonna ask my dad for help with finding a doctor who will actually help me. Maybe try to book an emergency appointment. Right now I'm gonna work on getting some work done and hopefully I can keep this up for a couple hours at least.",Upgraded ADHD,2
"I'm on 1200mg lithium, 200 mg lamictal.
We're going to go down from 1200mg to 900 mg lithium and then increase the lamictal.

It did not go well. Anxiety went up through the roof. Just super super bad.

Then I went back on 1200 (per psych) and the anxiety started improving. Now it's coming back.

I'm positive this is just my body's biochemistry adjusting back but wow this sucks.

I just needed to vent.",Failed medication change,2
"I really could use some success stories. Are you diagnosed yet still feel like your life is good, well balanced and you find it fulfilling? Tell me all about it please. I really need to hear some positive life stories",Living a fulfilling life despite bipolar,2
"I'm 30F. Been diagnosed since I was 14. By SEVERAL doctors. My parents never ""agreed"" (as if there's something to agree on a medical diagnosis) so I was unmedicated for most of my life so far. This gave me a lot of time to figure when a phase was coming, what triggers it, but also a lot of time to do stuff I shouldn't, which hindered me greatly. Because of that, I only started living on my own when I was 24, and that's when I started medication. 

To help with all this I have PCOS (which triggers depression) and long periods (which trigger anemia), so when I get my period I get depressive episodes AND I am physically exhausted and depleted. Which causes me to sleep more, which causes me to go further into depression. 

My bf does his best to understand but it's all a bit beyond his grasp. My parents still don't recognize my situation, so they are of no support for me. I don't have many friends, and only one of them is actually supportive, but she has a rough life and is usually busy with lots of work or something similar. 

So, I'm on my own. I want to straighten up my sleep schedules, but I know I can only do that by decreasing the amount of sleep drastically, which will trigger a maniac episode. It's mostly mixed, not generally full blown mania, but it does get there sometimes and it's like a kinder egg, you only know what you got when you open the box. So it can either go ""let's get the house deep cleaned"" or ""let's blow up our credit card, take on 76 projects I won't complete and f*ck the neighborhood"". You never know.

"Basically what it says in the title.

In theory, I know exercise helps with symptoms, and I like going to the gym when I'm not in the depths of depression. However, when I'm depressed, it's nearly impossible for me to motivate myself to go even semi-consistently. I get stuck doing nothing. I have trouble getting myself to put my gym clothes on, let alone actually walking there and completing a workout.

Also, I don't experience much, if any, of the usual pleasure I get after I work out (normally I'd feel better afterwards) when I'm depressed, so it's pretty hard to convince myself to do it because ""I'll feel better later"".

I've tried going for longer walks and other stuff, but if I'm honest dragging myself around my city in the rain alone with my dark thoughts doesn't help much. I go out most days with my dog, but when it gets bad I can't even begin to face it.

I know I sound like I'm being lazy and dramatic, but I'm serious. I really can't stand the idea of getting up, putting on my clothes, putting on my shoes, getting my dog ready, finding my keys, finding my phone, putting on my coat, locking up, going down the stairs in my apartment building, walking for 40 minutes, climbing the stairs again, then unlocking my door and going in. I get stuck between steps and find myself outside alone in the cold too sad to walk home, or staring at the stairs (pun) in my building unable to drag myself up them.

I get psychomotor slowing when I'm really bad.  It's physically difficult to walk. It feels like my body is made of lead. Sometimes it takes me over an hour to complete an activity that would normally take me half that time.

"this is literally just me going to vent bc i don’t have anyone rn and i feel like talking to a community that knows what i might be going through is more comforting than talking to people who i know aren’t going to get it or will worry them. 

so last Thursday my friend and I got into a big fight over me not answering my phone , the jist of that is i was called selfish and told i throw a pity party for myself every time I talk about my relationship with my mother ( it’s bad and has only gotten worse as im am adult now ) as well as her insinuating that i undermine their relationship with their parents ( which i do not , because that is not the type of person i am for whatever that’s worth ) and it ended with us blocking each other which is something i initiated bc I couldn’t deal with how uncommunicative she was being it alone interfered with a lot of other plans, like us going to prom together so now im torn about even going to that since it’ll be my senior prom but then the idea of being outside is to much 

so that Monday was my birthday and I had invited two other friends of mine , one of which I was supposed to be moving in with and had been planning to do so for years only for her to tell me the night i turn 18 that she doesn’t see it being realistic , which is fair and I’m not angry with her but it just seems like my life is falling apart , and I know in the future this won’t even matter but i am having borderline suicidal thoughts and can feel my depression getting so ugly that I can’t even look in mirrors or think about my future. 

i feel really lost and I’m trying to stay positive and have my perspective be that of gratitude but I’m struggling and im just so fucking scared about what I’m going to do in my life. I was thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend but I can’t even trust that the thought is mine or just my brain going into overdrive. I can’t even look people in the eye anymore . I just want to sleep and I want to run away and just go somewhere but I know that’s my avoidance talking.

"I’ve been struggling with daily functioning. See the cluster fuck of a last post I had on here as case in point. I’m not working because of PTSD plus bipolar making my brain panic mush. I’m doing better than I have with episodes in the past. I’m getting out of bed. I’m doing care for my little family, my husband and pets. I’m mostly taking care of the kitchen and all food related things for the household.

I’m just resting a whole hell of a lot more than I want to. I’m wasting away my day with nothing good to show for it. Probably 50% of the time I’m awake I’m in bed or sitting somewhere comfortable doom scrolling. I need to provide income so we’re not so tight on money. After consulting the hive mind of my friends and family everyone and myself have concluded that I need to start a business. I have an idea I’d like to track down but I can’t get going. It’s become an extended issue. I just can’t get going.

I have a tharapist I love and I can’t decide if I need to see her more often to work on this. Or if I need to go to occupational tharapy. I’ve done occupational tharapy in the past and found if useful, but I’m not convinced it would be a second time.

I’ve met my deductible so more tharapy with my regular tharapist is free. Tharapy with occupational I’d have to find in network.

"Background: I'm bipolar 2. I'm a 42 year old man. In addition to the bipolar, I'm autistic and have been severely abused throughout my life. My wife left me suddenly and with no warning after 15 years of marriage. I'm still in love with her despite her cheating on me twice. I blamed myself, but it doesn't change anything. She also left me with both of our kids, who I love a lot, they're 10 and 15. We've decided to slow date again, and see if we can actually be together, but she's already saying it's hopeless before the first date. Yeah, I know, it's a really bad sign, but I have to try for me.

Now: I can't stop sobbing all the time. Like hard, hurt sobbing. I'm in therapy and I'm on meds. I'm not actively suicidal, but I am starting to worry that I might be slipping into a suicidal trance. I think about it daily and I keep pushing the kids into my brain to stop it. I don't really have anyone to talk to because of the aforementioned marriage, there's a lot there and a LOT of people would tell me don't give her a second chance, including my 15 year old. I feel so fucking stupid for still loving her despite the harm she's caused me. But let's get back on subject. Today, when I was signing out of work on Slack I typed ""Bye"" to my boss unconsciously, I've never done that before, it's always been, ""See you Monday,"" or something else. I held my 3 cats each in turn today and just wept and hugged them. I wandered around the house (I work from home) after work and just felt melancholic and went into each of the rooms and thought about memories in that room. I don't know what my brain is trying to get me ready for, but I'm scared of myself right now. I can't really talk about it out loud to too many people because if the divorce goes forward I might lose custody of the kids because of it, even though they've both said they want to be with me and she is the one who left.

I also started a new job, i used to be a medical assistant, but i honestly think it made my condition so much worse. I think i always showed signs of being bipolar but never recognized them. But when i was a medical assistant i think it made me so much worse. I’m here because is anyone else’s mania miserable? When I’m manic it’s like I’m so overwhelmed with adrenaline. I cant sleep, extreme irritation/rage and horrible anxiety. How have you learned to tell the difference between how you actually truly feel, and when your being irrational?

I don’t really know what went wrong as I took my meds and I have a passive nature in general. No manic outbursts or emotional ones at all.  We all were laughing and having a great time laughing and doing fun activities. But as soon as I got home one of them just didn’t want anything to do with me anymore. And I truly believe it was discriminatory behavior because I would bring up my diagnosis/ make jokes of because they would do the same. (Making jokes of my diagnosis helps me cope in a way) It took me bit to collect myself but I’m doing a whole lot better with therapy now that they’re not in my life anymore. They were also very against seeking medical advice for mental illness and rather get high and not address their issues with a professional. Has anyone else here ever lost close friends that backstabbed you over your diagnosis?

She is not making these comments from a place of ill intentions.  I know mental illness is not a contest and mental health treatment is important for everyone.

But that came crashing down when I was suddenly arrested and dragged off to hospital in the New Year (I’d done nothing criminal but I guess I must’ve been acting strange). 

One of the hardest things for me is the shame and humiliation for how I acted when manic while being adamant that there was nothing wrong with me. In retrospect I could have been seriously harmed or worse when I used to roam around the streets at night and do risky things.

Then I asked what we were talking about and he gave me the most concerned look. I know he isn’t mad at me but worried. It’s happening so often I’ve started writing everything down. Like everything, conversations, tasks, reminders, messages I need to reply back to. It’s getting ridiculous. 

I’m currently taking Busprion 15 mg 3x a day, Hydroxyzine 50 mg 3x a day, Aripiprazole 10 mg 1x a day, and Buspar 150 mg 1x a day. 

Also, I work a very high stress job. I am a program coordinator for a low barrier homeless shelter. We deal with death, ODs, fights, assault of staff, rape allegations. It’s rough. Maybe this info will help? Idk. I just wanna know if it gets better or if I’ve given myself permanent brain damage.",Brain Fog/Memory Loss,2
"Hello everyone! This is my first time posting in this group. I was diagnosed with bp2 after struggling for years with depression and supposedly mania also. But I was also diagnosed with adhd a little over a month ago. Both felt like I was diagnosed relatively quickly. Idk if that’s a good or bad thing. My depression has always been bad especially in my teens but my best friend died of suicide when I was 18 and it got worse from there. Im currently 21 and have no will or desire to pretty much live( not suicidal I think) life just seems pointless when im always depressed, I have zero motivation to do anything. Im in therapy but it feels like it’s not helping. I was recently put on vyvanse to help with my supposed adhd diagnosis. It’s helped with my motivation a little but hasnt really done much. And every anti depressant/psychotic has either made me worse or done the bare minimum which is keeping me alive. Ive been on 5+ different medications since my bp2 diagnosis 2 years ago. Ive had maybe 2 or 3 hypo manic phases since my diagnosis but their never anything more than a day or 2 of euphoria and more motivation and a splash of poor impulsive decision making. I don’t really know where I’m going with this other than how the fuck do you guys deal with this? My lifes been at a complete stand still since I was around 16-17. I have no diploma, no job and not a single desire to pretty much be a human at this point. Sorry for the long post I just figured I’d give an insight to what life is for me.

Started latuda awhile ago and I just had my follow up appointment. My memory recall and all around cognitive abilities have declined significantly. I have anxiety and fears that I've never experienced. (Fear of death etc). You know what my psych told me? These aren't things common with latuda. He told me that I need to get tested for obstructive sleep apnea. All of my symptoms point towards that instead of mental illness. What the hell!

"I dated an undiagnosed bipolar 1, while I was an undiagnosed bipolar 2. We met on a mania in our early 20s. I’m sure many of you can imagine the drugs and “fun” we had on our high. 

I ended up pregnant. He came down hard and I started having suicidal thoughts from all the drama being bipolar entails. I had an abortion. It was the abortion or drive off a bridge. Even his catholic family had choice words for me, that made me feel all the more trapped.

I cleaned up and went back to college, and started traveling more. He went to rehab 2ce. I wrote him while in rehab the 2nd time. He was kicked out of rehab for acting on his hyper-sexuality. Him and the lady became a couple and had a daughter. I leave him alone, because now he’s diagnosed and I took a few college courses to educate myself on mental illness. I knew he wasn’t in full control. He would call me from fake numbers in the middle of the night, and we’d talk, never meeting up. His lady caught on and would call and confront me. I sent her receipts that it’s him after me. Eventually he stopped contacting me knowing I’d snitch.

It’s been 8 years and I’m now diagnosed, and medicated myself. I recently had my own daughter. I’ve been thinking about him, and looked him up. He reached out to me 2 years ago, right before I was diagnosed, and I responded with his arrest record.

As I’m looking into him, I find out he was in a coma from going in to cardiac arrest. He’s learning to walk, talk and move his hands again. It looks like he lost a finger. His family hasn’t posted any information about how or why. Also my daughter has the same name as his mom, totally forgot his moms name and my spouse picked the name.

I’m in this fog of wanting to reach out, but also, why? We are living separate lives. It’s been almost a decade! I questioned if it was real love or the mania for so long..

My spouse and father of my daughter is a good guy. He’s stable and loving. He isn’t jealous and we have talked about the ex in the past. We have agreed that we chose each other and not the ex’s. However, he will never understand what not being in full control is like.

It’s how I ended up on this sub. Looking to see if I was as crazy as I felt. Looking for similar experiences and stories, and boy did I find my community.

"Before I get into this, I know I was an asshole and I regret it so much that I’m crying. That’s why I’m here to ask so I don’t have to be judged by people I know. 

I’ve been fine for a while, surprisingly, considering I’ve been off my meds for a while. But yesterday was rough. I was starting to feel depressed and numb again so I did everything I could to keep it at bay. I went out, I tried to do hobbies, spend some time outside. But then my anxiety and paranoia started setting in. I feel like I was being watched and veery sound the woods made freaked me out. Eventually I couldn’t stand it anymore and had to go inside and go to bed. 

Something to note, I’ve been off my meds but just recently realized I was a fucking idiot and am moving back onto them. For context of the next day, I took some hydroxyzine last night to help me calm down and sleep. I tend to wake up a bit groggy but it fades. 

But today i’ve felt horrible. I’ve been depressed, irritable, paranoid, I just don’t want to be here anymore dealing with it. 
I have a dog and because of our house set up, I have to spend all day in the dining room with dining chairs and tile floor. No where to lay down. So I laid on the floor. Earlier I had been throwing a toy for my dog but stopped because my energy felt so low. 

As I was lying there, she kept nipping at my heels and barking when I told her to stop. Finally, my anger boiled over and I yelled at her. I said awful things to her that I don’t want to repeat, even to strangers on the internet. I put her in her crate and went to the bathroom to take a bath and calm down. I feel so awful about it and I hate feeling like this and hurting others. My medicine is supposed to help me but as soon as I started taking it again, this happened.

"hello! i’m writing here because i’m not too sure where else to look.

i have adhd, sensory processing disorder and an on the gifted spectrum. 
recently i’ve been going to therapy for adhd, and a few weeks ago my psych brought up that i might have bipolar. i’ve done a lot of research and have talked a lot about it when her,and i definitely have bipolar.
im going to see a psychiatrist and try to get meds for it, but i wanted to see if anyone else is like this before i get it checked out.

i do not experience intense anger. like… at all.
even before i started questioning if i had bipolar, i knew that i didn’t have the ability to get angry. 
sure, i get irritated- but that’s only at my family members. in public i don’t display or even feel anger. 

maybe it’s because as a girl, any negative or ‘masculine’ emotion is seen as undesirable, but plenty of girls get angry.


i know not all people with bipolar experience aggressive behaviour, but i feel like i should at least be a little angry? i’m irritable at the most, and i feel like it’s the only trait of bipolar i DONT experience.

"I wanted to cut layers in my hair as I always do, but this time, I messed up big time! I feel so stupid and sad. 

My hair is hip length and a big chunk in the front is not even chin length, it's like a bob with hip length hair at the back, man I loved my hair! Everyone loved my hair and now I feel so embarrassed because everyone is asking me, what happened? I feel so sad, I'm constantly Googling how long does hair take to grow out but it's so uneven, and that bothers me so much!

That's why I cut it in the first place because it was slightly uneven and it triggered my OCD, do people who have both bipolar and OCD, know what I mean? Sometimes, my OCD triggers a manic episode, and it's so hard to ignore these silly and persistent thoughts.

"I recently had to lower my lithium (under doctor supervision) because my lithium level was too high. I started to notice that I felt less numb. I felt butterflies in my stomach and a warm, fuzzy happy for the first time since I was a teenager. It was intoxicating. So I thought to myself, maybe I don’t need my lithium anymore. I never tried stopping it completely after ECT. This was a bad plan…

For the last few days I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time too. The overwhelming depression, self hatred and urge to harm myself. It was terrifying. And I found I was completely out of practice in suppressing those feelings. 

Back on my lithium… I am the first one to advocate taking your pills so I feel like a hypocrite. I have been reminded that deep in my mind bipolar is still there and still capable of destroying me. It was humbling, terrifying and discouraging all at the same time. Today I mourn the fact that I will never be able to fully feel emotions and will always have to be “sedated” to some degree. I shouldn’t complain because at least I have stability. But that taste of what life is really supposed to feel like and knowing I will never have it has left me in a bad way. I feel ungrateful for the stability I have and greedy for the way I used to feel before getting sick.

"I was diagnosed 6 years ago with type 2 bi polar disorder and my God what a fucking battle it has been, from being on various medications at first to being on/off with meds to being stable on meds and now eventually being off my meds.

Having this disorder is just too indescribable and majority of the people I've come across don't understand it, especially those close to me which is pretty fucked up. The constant questions of ""what's wrong with you"" to ""why are you like this""
When I try to explain to my family members that I have a disorder they turn around and say ""don't speak that over your life."" Like tf? (They quite religious)

Half the time I have no reason to feel how I feel and I control my impulses, my moods and my outbursts to seem normal to the world but its soooooo draining to feel like one day you on top of the world and life is great and then the next few days you feel like a piece of shit who doesn't deserve anything good. I guess thats just joys of not being on meds but even being on meds I still had to control it, there was better periods of stability but there was moments of is this shit working?

The episodes that come whether depressive or manic unfortunately it seems as if my family doesn't believe it and it's all in my head...excuse the pun there but its really fucked up. Having this disorder has messed with my life in ways I couldn't imagine and in the past I didn't know its coz I'm mentally ill, I just thought this is me being normal until I was diagnosed everything made sense as to why I am the way I am.

I've lost out on so much I've been through so much and the funny part is I have nothing to show for it like it's been a wasted life.

Dear Journal…well I really don’t know that much about you being dear… that’s clearly a lie as it is the first time I write in this type of journal -though I had been writing quite often on “my phone journal”-. Either way, dear beloved, and most precious electronic journal, I will bless thee with the presence of worded words that word the words I word. Today’s riveting topic…. My day! As I don’t think I have the mental capacity to write about anything else of meaning… or do I? The purpose of this journal thing is to make me a better writer in both English and Spanish, yet if all I put into the white walls is rubbish and nonsense, how am I to become better at throwing electronic ink at immaterial wood-stuff? Perhaps I should find something… as simple as it may be…something I can turn into cohesion. I guess it is as good a time as ever to speak about feelings… my feelings, nonetheless.

How does anxiety feel? I know we’ve all been there. Any E-scripture on anxiety that you might stumble upon will say as much, but, baring mental health professionals, I don’t think that those of us that enunciate the word “anxiety” with statistical-outlier levels of frequency have the same notion of the concept than those whose usage falls into the mean. What I mean by that, of course, is that those of us afflicted by pathological levels of anxiety feel it in a quantitively and qualitatively different way. I guess that’s why we get diagnosed… catalogued as distinct by the authorities that oversee defining this part of society. We’re a messy bunch. It reflects in all facets of my life.

I have messy hair, messy eyes, my room is messy my thoughts are scattered (and messy!), I can’t make a decision for the love of myself; the short version: I don’t work. I mean that both literally and figuratively, whatever that means! (think about it! What does the verb “to work” mean in a literal way? Is it having a job? But that’s having a job, we call it work because you do motions in a job, but we call the motions “work”, because “work” is the act of physical exertion right? I don’t know, this is literal garbage that I’m talking right now (talking/writing “garbage” can’t literally be literal (I think I just transferred a calque from Spanish, too long to get into this tangent))). I can’t hold a normal job; I can’t hold my emotions most of the times. Today some guy at the mall forgot my coffee, and I felt like as if I’ve murdered someone. I mean, I’ve never killed anyone -and I hope I never do such a heinous thing-, but you know that feeling you get in your chin, your chest and neck that pushes you down? The one you get when something bad, really bad is about to happen? I was feeling that over a coffee man. I stared the guy directly in the eye, not with the best of intentions. I was literally offended, but I don’t feel that it was in a normal way. How do I know that? Cause I didn’t use to be like that. Emotions, to me, seem to work now like to a BPD patient (perhaps I have BPD traits?). How do emotions work for BPD patients? Simple! Take an emotion X and then square it. A more detailed example: anger(in BPD afflicted individual) = anger\^2. Or perhaps it’s even a cubical function: i.e., anger\^3 (I don’t even remember if cube is exponential 3). Anxiety is writing parenthesis excusing yourself of mistakes in your personal journal entries that no one else will ever fucking read.

Anxiety is looking at your neighbor and running away inside your home for no reason. Anxiety is feeling gutted for dreaming about the people that made you the happiest you’ve been in ages. Anxiety is snapping at those who love you, because you can’t love yourself and everything has a bitter taste to shit. Anxiety is wanting to die, looking at places where you could hang yourself, feeling relief at the thought of no longer breathing, imagining a knife to the throat, thinking about swerving into traffic, travelling, and not feeling anything, kissing someone you’re deeply into and not feeling anything, doubting everything you do, every single cell in your body being inadequate. Anxiety is knowing at a scientific level that something is wrong, but still suffering through it. Anxiety is abusing drugs, anxiety is depression, anxiety is the antithesis of life, of enjoyment, of love and all that’s good. This is “anxiety”, as this is obviously a corrupted, poisonous version of a feeling that’s supposed to help us survive: i.e., anxiety. “Anxiety” turns a survival tool against those who are trying to survive.

Photograph \*everything\* important - passports, credit cards, boarding passes, luggage, and store the photos in a locked folder on your phone. This helps recovery of lost items, lower your footprint if you get robbed, and it creates backups because you never know.

Try to research as much ahead of time - Rick Steves advises to book the important stuff, but keep things open ended. I've found, since I'm so easily distracted, to have a few good options at all times that you can do in case things are getting weird. 

Go easy on the coffee - first thing I want to do in an airport or a new city is to have coffee. There's downtime, I'm jetlagged, weary, and already overstimulated, and caffeine I think adds to my disorganization. If I get lost, it makes me look even more like a crackhead asking for directions.

He's in prison now but it doesn't erase the damage done to her or me.

I had 6 months med access instability, 1.5 years of job instability, housing environment instability, other health problems (ever tried to use your hands when you can't feel 80+ percent of them?) and these god damn hallucinations and crying spells really need to fking stop.

I've been trying out more meds, different med combos, self-care, coping mechanisms. I've been in therapy and physical therapy and those are helping. I keep my appointments with my specialists and p-doc. I do my job the best I can and try to keep my shit together but I've been barely holding my head above water for such a long time with it all and I feel like I'm about to drown.

No, correction. I feel like I'm drowning. I've been drowning for a  while and I just realized it.

I'm just trying to survive and it's getting harder and harder to do so. I'm bawling just typing this out.

I did my taxes today and for the first time in the 13 years of paying taxes I authorized someone else to talk to the irs if necessary.  I wrote down my important login information. I've been talking to my dad and my sister about the gist of everything. I know my sister will take care of my cat if I can't, I've already gone over all of Annie's overall care and needs especially regarding her medical care and environmental needs.

I need a fresh start. There are too many ghosts in this area that haunt me and my dreams. I've had too much loss and trauma to call it home anymore. I want to move up north to the only place I can call home. I want to move into my dad's place and live with one of the few humans I trust.

I brought it up today and he's thinking about it. I will see what his thoughts are about it later.

I can't stand how things are anymore and I need to be better.

In addition to my lithium, lamictal, vyvanse, buspirone, propranolol and gabapentin, I started vraylar last week but it's not working fast enough so I start olanzapine tomorrow. Maybe it will help me. I'm really hoping it will help me because I can't hold it together anymore, not even for my cat.

I'm going to be paying cash for my meds for a little while until I can get on Medicaid, but that's okay. I'm hoping to fill my meds as soon as my insurance lets me (up to 5 days before the days supply ends) so I can build up extra. Maybe try to get a vacation override or something towards the end. I'm gonna work some extra shifts to build up some money. I gotta get Annie to the the vet for her annual exam and refills of her phenobarbital. And ask the vet if she will authorize an early refill or prescribe a larger volume so there's more of a buffer zone for her (because her seizures are both heartbreaking and terrifying at the same time).

I have so much to do! I have more hope again. God damn I love my dad. He's always been beyond awesome and supportive, he has been one of my biggest supporters in multiple ways over the years. I legitimately don't know if I would be here typing this if he wasn't who he is.

"i’m not sure where the best place to ask this is. i’m too afraid of bringing it up to my providers so i’m hoping i can seek support here before i mention anything.
i’m diagnosed bipolar type 1, i’ve only had one manic episode that led to psychosis. mostly, i struggle with rapid cycles of mixed mania, hypomania and depression when unmedicated.
the last maybe month or so(?) i guess i’ve had a decreased need for sleep. so much that my psychiatrist noticed it before i did and prescribed medicine for sleep. i’m taking my mood stabilizers regularly but for some reason i just cannot make myself take sleeping medication and these past two weeks i’ve noticed have been pretty worrisome while reflecting on it(change in sex drive and drugs, unlike myself and putting myself in dangerous situations) i’m just really afraid of bringing it up to anybody for fear of judgement. i know how silly it is to have the solution to my problem right in front of me, and i don’t want to make it seem like i don’t care about my mental health.
i am experiencing all symptoms of (hypo?)mania and some mixed features of depression. it was really nice for a few days of this week but just like my first manic episode, the only way i can describe it is like, you’re going so high up on a roller coaster that when you feel it slipping down, it’s scary and drastic and you do everything you can to keep going up just so it doesn’t crash. i feel like im in the beginning stages of that and i really don’t want to do this. the euphoria and attractiveness of mania is incredible, but the constant racing thoughts and heart rate, the irritability and anxiety are uncomfortable and i know im prone to psychosis.
it seems like the easiest solution would be to actually take my prescribed medication, but it is really hard for me. i feel like there’s so much more time i have to get stuff done later in the night and i see it as a waste to go to bed so early especially when i don’t need to. i’m aware of how ridiculous it all sounds but i don’t know what to do to make myself take the medication. i know i have to but i genuinely just do not want to, but unfortunately i know this is probably contributing to mania.

And I had some doubts (I'm not asking for diagnosis) because lately I have been going through dark days, but today something extremely strange happened to me that I do not know how to name or explain to my psychiatrist. If anyone has felt this way, I would appreciate it if you could tell me about your experience please. 

I was talking with a friend about my emotions, and I remember that from one moment to the next I got caught up in a specific thought (like a delusion). And then it was like I had emotionally exploded, I felt out of myself, I started sobbing very loudly, my breathing was heavy, I couldn't control or stop myself. But it wasn't like the moment or the conversation led me to it because of the intensity, it just happened. I was hugging myself, I couldn't stand him touching me. I felt like I was getting small. I really have no idea how to explain it, but what was most impressive to me was how spontaneous it was and that feeling of not being in control of my own body. After that i felt numb and confused.",I dont know what happened to me,2
"I've been to a couple of interviews and I think the interviewers just see into my soul. I want to have a job, but I can't find one. I'm too eccentric and probably I don't even care if I work or not. I feel like they see it whenever we make eye contact. They see that I would be a bad employee.

I don't care about anything at all at this point.",Job hunting,2

Hi all, I’m really sorry if this post triggers anybody, please don’t read if you’re prone to being triggered by content relating to depression/despair. 

With that in mind, how the fuck am I supposed to be excited about living the rest of my life? I’m only 23 years old, and I’m so goddamn tired. The older I get, the more acutely aware I get of just how wrong my brain is. I try so hard, and it can’t be fixed? As we all know. I’m on medication, but in a few months I’ll be off my moms insurance and I CANNOT afford private insurance. I know everyone says we NEED to be on meds, and I agree. I need to be on meds. But staring down the barrel right now, I know I cannot and will not be able to just a while from now. And I hate this fucking disorder so much, because all it does is lie to you. I can’t trust my happiness or my sadness or my apathy. I am genuinely so exhausted of managing these feelings, and it gets worse every year as I get more and more compounded “adult” stress. How am I supposed to want to go on like this? And no I am not at risk of ending my life, I have too much guilt and shame to think of doing that to my family, but that just compounds the pain of existing for no reason beyond obligation. How do you all do it? Why do you all do it? Literally any input or advise or comment is appreciated to help me feel maybe just a little less alone, sorry for being so whiny.",How am I supposed to look forward in life?,2
"I've been taking Lamictal for three years now. From the beginning it has been apparent that I am allergic to it. A very strange kind of reaction, my hands start to burn (inside my skin, if you touch my hands they are normal temperature), and then they start to itch. They burn and itch so much I end up putting them under water constantly. 

I started taking some antihistamines with it and I've been ok for three years. This med has changed my life, like entirely. It made me stable, able to hold a job, and so much more. I can't live without it. 

But recently, my hands started to itch again. Slowly. I take my antihistamine in the evening, I'm fine all day long the following day, and then in the evening it starts to itch again. My overall skin as well. 

I'm worried I will have to stop taking my Lamictal. It has been wonderful. No side effects whatsoever. If I stop taking it, I won't take any other medication because I don't want to gain weight, or hurt my kidneys. 

Have any of you gone through something similar? With allergies? I talked to a pharmacist when I started doing this and they told me I couldn't become resistant to antihistamines. I'm starting to doubt this...",Allergic to Lamictal,2

I can still force myself to get up and do stuff like clean, shower, etc. But I'm extremely miserable about it and everything else that doesn't involve sleeping., I don't cry omw to work, during work and while showering anymore, I don't have ""those scary thoughts"" anymore and I can keep a gym schedule although during my depressive periods the amount of gym sessions I get in are significantly less.

"First, thank you for reading my rant, even if you don't make it to the end...

Life advice please...

30f, relationship with 31m, anf we have a 9mo son.

We lost the home we were renting back in Dec, due to mold. We've been back and forth between the in-laws since. I'm in school and he is looking for work, but also is waiting for his Bar exam results.

I can't stand living with other people. I'm currently dealing with my mental health (Bipolar and ADHD) and it's hard to function at times. The other day I was overwhelmed by my MIL who wanted us to bring the baby over to meet some family last minute. That ended with me yelling at her when she came to the car wanting to take my son out because he was crying. I told her to worry about her children, not mine.

This morning at 6am, I woke up to find my partner in his parents room talking. When he came back he stated ""It's me &amp; you"" over and over. Later, he explained how no one will understand me or my Bipolar and how much weight I carry and how hard it can get for me on a daily basis. He didn't go into full details of the convo because I'm an overthinker, but him stating his parents asking if I'm in therapy or taking medications, made it obvious. That's when my partner got upset because he saw how I consistently have to deal with our families not understanding. As I told him, not many ever will.

I hate living with the in-laws. I love them, but I don't do well with the MIL always home. Having someone consistently there and always watching what's being done with my son, being there to greet him all the time, or making opinions like ""he's hungry, he wants milk, look at this, look at that"" etc has really been getting on my nerves. To the point that now I can't stand her voice or go into a negative mood when I know she's going to be around.

My partner and I both feel uncomfortable staying at each others parents. Financially we are unstable at the moment and were trying to figure out what our next move is...

When my son was born, the first two weeks, we got covid. Then, after 6 months of living alone, we lose our home to mold. During Christmas, I went through a perfect storm of depression with losing the house and overwhelmed by everyone wanting to meet my son. I feel like his first year was one of the hardrst for me and I want to be able to enjoy these 3 months before he turns a year, but it's been so hard...

SO!

Any advice? Any recommendations on work from home? Any knowledge regarding starting a dropshipping business to earn an income?

I need to do something because I can't keep living thi way. This is the most I've thought about suicide and that's not fair to me or my son!

"So... I usually don't post anything on Reddit, but here we go.

About eight months ago, I was diagnosed with BP2. I've struggled with mental health issues all my life (anxiety, depression) and developed PTSD at a pretty young age. After a few years of fluctuating emotions I went to see a psychologist, and I got my diagnosis. I was also diagnosed with asperger's syndrome back in 2019.

I've been on a mood stabilizer (lamictal) since I was diagnosed, and it's made things easier for me, but exam season (last year of high school) is coming up and I lowkey feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm experiencing mixed moods every other week, I can't really sleep anymore, and every day I'm torn between ignoring everyone around me, freaking out, or acting friendly, because I know I shouldn't take my own mental illness out on anyone. I'm either tired, stressed, occasionally productive, or filled with a kind of self-loathing and sadness that I can't even begin to describe. I'm worried I'll be thrown straight into a depressive episode soon, because stress is my biggest trigger. Very few people (two of my friends and my immediate family) know that I'm bipolar, and I don't even want to tell **them** about how I feel right now. I think a lot of people on here can relate to that crushing feeling that you're a burden to your loved ones, even when they tell you you're not. I considered the possibility that things might get better if I told someone, but I just don't have the energy, and I don't want to let people in because I'm ashamed that I'm losing control. Explaining how I feel to someone is difficult (asperger's, yay) and there aren't many people I trust with my emotions. The people I trust are the ones I don't want to burden.

I wanted to ask, does it get any easier? Not to board the self-pity train or anything, but I'm not even 20, and thinking about the future terrifies me. I don't want to fall apart and fake that I'm okay every time a problem arises. I don't want to isolate myself because I'm scared of affecting people. I don't want to experience all these episodes over and over again. I just... don't know what to do right now.

Also, if anyone has any advice on how to keep going and staying productive, I'd really appreciate it. &lt;3",Are things going to get any better?,2

Does anyone else experience these in spurts? I’ve seen research that says it could be a manic episode coming on. I haven’t remembered my dreams in a while but i’ve had a bad one every night the past four days. They always happen right before I wake up.,So many nightmares.,2
"I know I've had at least one episode of what was probably psychosis because I was diagnosed with stress induced psychosis when it was happening. I don't know if that one was bipolar related or not, and I wasn't treated with anything at the time because I was still quite young and the psychiatrist didn't want to intervene with medication.

However, I've had other symptoms since during what were probably undiagnosed manic or mixed episodes where I've started to believe things that were, retrospectively, pretty weird. Occasionally these beliefs also pop up when I'm very, very depressed. Sometimes I believe these things 100% unquestioningly, and other times I know they don't make sense but worry about them excessively anyway. Sometimes it fluctuates between the two.

A common one for me is worrying that other people can hear my thoughts, especially if I look at them directly. I also get concerns about people working against me or talking about me behind my back to try to ruin my life.

Another time I became convinced my childhood home was haunted and that a demon had followed me from there into my daily life. I kept seeing a figure in my room at night and I worried about speaking about him out loud in case he came for me. I still worry about this sometimes, and tbf I'm pretty sure that house really was haunted. My childhood friends and I talk about the weird slightly paranormal stuff that happened there so I'm not alone with that, but my sudden obsession with it was abnormal.

I told a different psychiatrist about those two a while back and he said it was probably due to a combination of autism and trauma, and that it would likely go away with more EMDR. Since they kind of just left as my mood changed, he was satisfied that his therapy had worked.

I had another one where I decided I was actually naturally nocturnal and that other people were interfering with that to purposefully make me sick and stop my plans. I completely flipped my sleep schedule for several weeks (although admittedly I wasn't sleeping very much anyway), and then fought with all my family and friends about it.

At one point I also became very worried that other dog walkers were all talking about me on Facebook and were plotting to take my dog away. 

Another time I was certain I was dying of some horrible illness and all the medical professionals I saw weren't treating me on purpose because they wanted me to die. (I really was sick though, but the level of paranoia was weird).

I was still somewhat functional while all of these were happening, and I wasn't hearing voices or anything for the most part. So does it really count as anything serious? Because it didn't seem that bad to me, and my family just kind of ignored it since they'd been told that the episodes were stress related and it was best not to engage. I've never told a psychiatrist about all of the thoughts because I didn't view them as relevant; until recently, I just thought they were a part of life and it was something I did when I got stressed.

TLDR; at what point does it cross the line into actual psychosis vs ""being paranoid and having weird thoughts""?

I'm going to be starting medication for the first time soon if all goes well. My current psychiatrist is talking about putting me on antipsychotics, but idk if these episodes are really bad enough to warrant taking an antipsychotic. I've been reading about the drugs and they sound like heavy duty stuff, and I can't tell if, for me, it's really necessary. I think I'd rather try another type of mood stabilising medication first.

"Hey everyone, to start I’m a 21 year old female living in the United States. I come from a family that has a close history of Bipolar and ADHD. My grandfather has pretty severe bipolar and due to his refusal to fake traditional medication he’s an addict and has been separated from my family since I was a child. 

I’ve shown signs of being bi-polar for a very long time now, was diagnosed with ADHD, got on the meds for that, but still struggled significantly. I knew everything I was experiencing pointed to Bipolar II, but with it being so taboo in my family after my grandpas actions I refused to ever admit it. 
However now after talking with my psychiatrist he strongly believes I am bipolar and we will start a more in depth diagnosis beginning soon. 

I have mixed feelings, I’ve known that this was most likely the answer but I didn’t want it to be true.

well, after all of the weird behavior, i was urged to see a psychiatrist. and then I was diagnosed.

Ever since being diagnosed and given medication (my first time ever taking daily meds…), i feel somewhat at unease. Even though i have a weird feeling, right now i feel pretty stable and happy. i honestly didnt know medicine could change my life so much. 

But i feel like after experiencing my first manic episode, something in me has changed. Even when im feeling stable, theres some underlying feeling my mood may swing at any given moment. I am still working on finding the best meds for me, so maybe that may have something to do with it?

"starting this off by establishing that I am autistic, and one of my interests is self categorization. this can make me come across as a hypochondriac or doctor shopper, as I know my disorders/illnesses very well. once I started seeking treatment for my bipolar I learned everything there was to learn, joined communities such as this one, and started talking to others with bipolar.

as a result of this, I learned a lot about medication. not even really on purpose, learning about the meds people are on is just an inevitable of being in a group like this.

my psyche prescribed me abilify today, and out of curiosity I asked if that was the med known to sometimes lead to tardive dyskinesia. I'm not against trying abilify, all meds can have horrible side effects, but I wanted to know if that's what I was potentially getting myself into. I love my psyche, she's super nice and receptive, but she sorta laughed and told me to ""stop googling your medication"" which rubbed me the wrong way. it's a drug I'm unfamiliar with, should I not want to be prepared for the potential risks? I've told her before I'm open to trying anything, so it's not like I was telling her I wouldn't take it because I was scared, I was just asking a question so I know what to look out for.

"tl;dr should I read Choice Theory or should I change therapists?

So, my therapist has suggested that I read Choice Theory by William Glasser... I used a credit on audible to get it, it is a little over 12 hours long... I haven't started it yet, but what I have read about choice theory tells me I will disagree with a main premise, which my therapist and I kinda got into today...

He insists that thoughts and emotions are choices. Going so far as to say that mental illness is a choice. In regards to bipolar, if you are not having negative consequences, do you have bipolar? Because you can choose your actions and reactions and emotions and thoughts.

That medicine is a crutch and is not necessary.

He says that this gives you the power to control your life and swings and even get rid of swings.

This came up when I was asking about tools because my regular tool for dealing with intrusive thoughts isn't really cutting it for me right now (having the thought, then saying to myself, is this thought beneficial/useful/helpful to me?)

There are several things here that I am in complete disagreement with. Medicine is necessary, thoughts and emotions are not controllable (i.e. they just happen, but can potentially be directed) and, mental illness is real and not a choice.

Sure you can do things to help mitigate symptoms and try and improve yourself, but ~~I am pretty sure~~ I will always have bipolar. He has planted a seed of doubt.

"Hi friends! Sorry if this is the wrong place to post.

I (20F) was diagnosed with BD2 back around October, so still fairly recent. I am super lucky to have a family that encourages me to keep going to therapy and stay on medication, however I’m finding  they don’t really *understand* what I’m going through.

While I’m aware there’s no real way for them to conceptualize what is actually happening to me during hypo episodes more specifically (was misdiagnosed w depression at 17, depression I feel is a little easier understood) I’d like to be able to have them be aware of what an episode is like. I can’t exactly put it all into words when trying to explain it to them myself, and I often feel like doing that ends up scaring/worrying them more. So I’m looking for a resource that can detail what hypomania is really like, whether that be a day-to-day kind of thing, or just an extensive list of symptoms. 

Most recently I spent several days awake, and have had obvious weight loss, which led my dad to ask my older brother if he thought I had been getting into meth/coke, as my dad was previously addicted to meth and experienced similar symptoms.

"The most recent manic episode I had was after being depressed and diagnosed with major depressive disorder to be prescribed Zoloft. Within 6 weeks I was staying up for 9 days and delusional. I thought my partner was going to kill me so I called 911. The police arrived and I was very agitated and explained my delusions and they took me to the nearest psych ward for an evaluation. Unfortunately, that psych ward didn’t keep me long enough despite my volunteering to stay longer. They also gave me a medication I ended up allergic to which took treatment even longer.

This resulted in asking my in-laws who live in a different state miles away to help me care for my daughter until I found the right medication combination and was stable. I knew it could take a few months and I had no one else available local to me. The only way my inlaws would take my daughter is if I signed over guardianship. I was under the impression it would only be for a year at the most. But honestly, I wasn’t really in the right mind to consent to that paperwork. I just knew I needed help and I did what I could to ensure my daughter had the best care possible while I got stable. 

Fast forward to now my partner and I petitioned the courts to end guardianship as I have been stable for 2 years. I have letters from my therapist and pdoc stating I am in treatment and stable and medication compliant. 

Well, my in-laws are trying to prove I am unfit for things I did while I was manic so they can adopt my daughter without my consent or permission through the courts. They're also trying to prove that my partner (their child) is unfit I am less worried about that. 

My therapist says they're on a witch hunt and that they're just trying to raddle me and no judge would grant them adoption. I hope she's right.

"TLDR : I'm bipolar type two with mixed features currently in a hypomanic (mixed?) episode.
I experience some of these things:
- clenched jaw
- 10-15 minute panic attack that disappears in a few seconds leaving you confused but not feeling  bad (just very confused)
- nightmares and night sweating
- completely forgetting to eat and losing the instinct of eating or liking food except shit like sweets cola coffee and chips (with cigs ofc)
Do you?

Note : I'm like 95% sure I'm hypomanic right now and have been for almost a month but was in denial until a week ago, seeing psychiatrist on Friday to talk. 

Anyway, I'm experiencing these things and was wondering if anyone else had this: 
- clenched jaw most of the time
- random 10-15 minute panic attack/dark dissociation (few times a week, had one where i couldn't contain a scream that was just so guttural like I was giving birth and then started hyperventilating so hard I almost fainted and had to sit down and hold onto something to not fall), but then all of a sudden you have a posotive thought and it disappearears in a second making you wonder what even happened and laughing at how dramatic you are
- nightmares or night sweating
- completely FORGETTING TO EAT, like losing the instinct to eat, even when I'm hungry I don't think about food but I think of resolving the problem so I stuff myself with the easiest fastest food that's kinda nutritious and idc about the taste, like plain slices of protein bread, Bananas (I don't even like the texture or the taste of bananas but its the cleanest and most efficient for hunger), vegan pre-made protein shakes in bottles (over 2 months I've consumed about ~100 of them, I have one every morning and other shit ""meal"" mentioned above) and SOMETIMES have the patience to boil a pack of ravioli that takes 3 minutes to cook and eat it just with olive oil and balsamic vinegar or airfry in 10 minutes a pack of vegan nuggets or fish sticks and eat them plain, yup, no sauce and not evem fried, such a treat (less dishes). 

Btw I'm also diagnosed with mixed episodes and I've experienced them, but usually they are way darker and cold with a bit of psychotic moments, and I just feel superior to others like an evil God and I'm full of rage.
Whereas here I feel quite at peace but a bit out of control, but I know that I'm gonna take care of it soon (going back tomorrow to my parents).

"I was diagnosed with Bipolar last May after trying to kill myself and did seven nights in a pysc ward which did me so much good.

For awhile before my diagnosis I had talked to my doc about ADHD cause I felt I fitted the symptoms of that so was in shock when I was eventually diagnosed with Bipolar.  When on what I call highs I get extremely productive.  I get so much done and take up new hobbies that never last more than a couple of months.  My lows are never so bad I'm depressed, but I have no energy mentally or physically and no interest in doing anything and I fall behind on everything.  The house gets messy and I struggle to achieve anything.

I have 3 kids so my anxiety goes through the roof when things get messy.  I'm snappy to be around for my wife and my mother and I get into moods because everything in the house is messy again.  It's like a vicious circle.  My lows causes me to let the place get untidy and the mess causes me to spiral into worse moods.

But sometimes when I read what other people go through and mine doesn't seem so bad in comparison I start to doubt I even have Bipolar.  These thoughts sneak into my head, I feel like an imposter and that I'm not really as bad as I think, and I'm only lazy, subconsciously tricking people and cheating by being on illness benefit.

We also happen to be moving across the UK for my husband's work in July. If all goes well, I could be pregnant by then.

I told my psychiatrist this and he told me that my antidepressant, clomipramine, is dangerous to the baby in pregnancy and can cause serious heart defects.

Clomipramine worked for me I think because it's also effective in OCD and while I don't have OCD, my depressive thoughts are definitely obsessive. I've been taking clomipramine for since a mild depressive episode I had a year ago and since I haven't had any depression at all and I haven't gone manic either.

I'm just worried with the move (even though I'm really looking forward to it) and the pregnancy and the medication change might be too much. As a mother, I feel having a serious episode is not an option, but then am I just putting more pressure on myself? Is this crazy? Should I try it or wait another year with the baby? Even just changing medication worries me, but I can't consider pregnancy without doing that first.

I don't know exactly what I'm asking for here. Reassurance? Sanity check? Advice? Any and all of that is welcome.","Switching meds, planning pregnancy, and moving across country. Recipe for disaster?",2
"Anybody else feel like their brain is bombarding them constantly? It’s 3 major things for me:

2. Intrusive thoughts. Could be anything from violent and disturbing images to something super benign. I have a bag of Mamma Chia brand chia seeds, every time I see I think “mamma chia, mamma chia figaro.”

"hey all.

i was recently diagnosed. to sum up my dilemma, my entire life anytime i’ve had a medical problem arise, i’ve always been dismissed as it being “anxiety”. i have a history of unexplained syncope episodes &amp; wacky blood test results but no doctor has ever taken me seriously. perks of being a 22 year old female. i’ve been told to take antidepressants for viral illnesses &amp; the like. so i’ve grown costumed to having a distrust towards doctors or i feel like they just use me for money &amp; don’t listen to me, ya know?

anyway, that’s not why i’m here. i hit rock bottom a few months ago &amp; have been seeing a wonderful therapist who truly advocates for me &amp; gives me a voice. he referred me to a psychologist &amp; we did the whole genesight thing. she wants me to start taking latuda.

i did the whole googling the medicine thing &amp; asked some friends about it, &amp; i have yet to see a good review. i also don’t want to be even more tired than i am now as i’m exhausted 24/7 as is. &amp; im scared meds could impact work or school.

i guess i’m just here asking for validation to ease my anxiety. will meds actually help me? or will i feel miserable? i’m really scared. i’m so hyper aware of my body &amp; i freak out about any minor change, even headaches. but also as the months go on the more i feel wildly reckless &amp; isolated. if i start taking them, &amp; want to get off them, will they forever change me like antidepressants can? i’d rather enjoy my few months of mania no matter how wild it can be vs forever be different..

"I'd like to preface first by saying that I'm not American.

I've been diagnosed bipolar II a few year ago during while in a psych ward. During all the years I've been seeing psychiatrists, it was brought up only once by a psychiatrist I've seen for less than a month. I've been somewhat successfully treated with seroquel. 

While I thought I had BP before my diagnosis,  this diagnosis as almost always made very little sense to me. I do have some pretty extreme mood swings, but far more than 4-5  a year and they sometimes last only hours.

The psychiatrist who followed me years never brought it up. He didn't change my meds, didn't really take any interest in my symptoms. He was pretty much happy just continuing the traitement that was prescribed to me during my trip to the psych ward. Last therapist didn't seem to believe I had any illness.

I'm seeing any therapists or psychiatrists anymore and I have stopped my meds. So far, I'm doing alright.

"I'm currently in the middle of diagnosis for bipolar 2. I got already medication (lamictal) even though I didn't yet get a official diagnosis, since at psychiatrist appointment we didn't have enough time to go through all the diagnosis criteria, and if my sympotoms fit in to those.

With psychiatrist we've been going through my possible hypomanias but specially been  focused on one which was the most severe one. During this period I broke up with my boyfriend (do not regret it), had  a huge crush before breakup, slept with the person I had a crush few days after breaking up, felt really happy and energetic, got involved in politics, slept 5h a night (usually 8+h), got in an out of situationships, went to parties, told everybody how beautiful I am (usually I'm not happy with my body). My psychiatrist didn't ask on my drug use but I've realized that before this episode or in the beginning of this episode I took some psychedelics. I really don't want drug use on my medical records since I've been sober for a year now. Does anybody else have any feelings on drug use on their medical records?

If I tell my psychiatrist I have taken illegal drugs before the episode I might not get the diagnosis. But then again I suffer from mood swings and cyclic severe depressions. I don't know anymore what is my normal state and if I exaggerate my possibly hypomanic symptoms. I've had other hypomanic episodes as well. In one I had for few weeks I moved in with a guy for a month who I'd known for two days, didn't fly back to home even though covid-19 restrictions were starting, posted dancing videos on instagram, said I love you to the person I was living with, had unprotected sex. But again this person was very manipulative and was gaslighting me, love bombing, and getting mad for me moving out. I feel like my psychiatrist could very easily misdiagnose me since my hypomanias might be caused some other things such as drugs or manipulation. How do you feel, is hypomania something that can't be caused by other factors in your life?

Whole my life, I have been doing impulsive decisions like gotten three tattoos at once (my first ones), brought flight tickets for next day, traveled by myself, applied to new schools, cheated, went to strip club (not normal to me), had hookups. On all of these I've had regrets as well. I don't know what is my personality and what not. If I tell my psychiatrist that these actions were not normal to me then I probably get the diagnosis.

I know my BP isn't the worst there is, but I see so many people with bipolar who are successful, and I guess I want to hear about the worst case scenario so I don't feel like I myself am the worst case, because I feel like absolute shit all the time due to my lack of success in any area of life.

"Hi y’all! I cannot use the TW flair I dunno why.
I am overall stable. But something happened today and I FEEL manic. Grandiose thoughts, hyper active brain (usually my brain is quiet and organised, now it works so much I have a headache lol) etc, you name it. Dreams of doing this and that, eh. And I couldn’t even take a nap.
All because... I wrote to my aunt I was never close with. Yes you read it right. You might ask yourself- „ee, what?” I hasten to explain.
So there was the year 2019, I went full-blown manic. It was really intense. My closest family was away but they knew something was up because of the things I had been telling them, my online activity and overall behaviour reported by more distant family that lives nearby. (I visited them xx times per day.)
So one time I really was scared I will die or something, I opened the door to run to the family nearby and when I opened the door there was this aunt (she is not the one I visited, she lives also nearby, but more far away then the other family members)
I was afraid to sleep (I didnt sleep properly in this time period, only kind of blacked out) 
She tuckled me to sleep and I had some rest. 
When my closest family came back, clearly distressed (the way the house looked + many other things) they called the ambulance and there I was in the mental hospital lol. 
This aunt was helping my mother to deal with me.
Ok now back to these times, this aunt is a kind of person that forwards these pictures with written things on them to everybody. As I don’t own the whatsapp app, I wasnt reading them. I only installed it sometimes and I wrote like a flower to her as a response or wishing also everything well (as a response to these pictures)
Today I opened whatsapp and the last pictures from her were at the beginning of march. It was unusal because she used to send them a lot. I kind of regretted not replying more to her even with a flower emoji and I randomly send her „happy (second) day of spring 🌷”
And like that, it kind of switched something in my brain lol. 
I want to mention that my mania was always occuring in spring/summer time. 
It is a little bit chaotic but english isnt my first language. I wish I didnt send this message.
There is also a possibility that I somehow didnt get these pictures and she was still sending them.

"Anyone have a similar experience?

When I became completely manic, it felt like I had to use different persona for a different group of people and also had this idea that my exes and toxic people were stalking me. 

So I had over 6 IG accounts. At least. There might be more because I also had THREE phones back then.

I just charged one of the phones I frequently used during the last manic episode and found out it has been public for over a year when I thought all my accounts were private. 

I am so embarrassed because I don't know who's seen it. 

Probably a lot of my old co-workers because I might have asked one of them who was my best friend to tag me on his account. Maybe my friends who left me during an earlier manic episode saw the account. I don't know. 

I cannot believe I left it to be seen by the whole world... I wonder that is why my ex cut me off entirely when we used to be friends even after we broke up. I wonder that's why some people randomly said - earlier this year - they thought I was taken to a hospital.

Anyway, I don't know if I will be able to sleep tonight. Now I am actually laughing out loud because this is just unbelievable. 

This almost feels like I'm in a movie where the protagonist is stuck in this limbo of facing all the crazy manic shit from the past everyday. 

Sometimes I try to be grateful for the things I still have. Sometimes I'm glad I finally accepted that I have this mental illness. But, today... this shook me to the core and I guess I do still care a lot about things I swore I could not care about any more. 

It feels like everything was part of this weird movie that was filmed... and it had no script, was directed by a nasty, unprepared, direction-less amateur director who wanted to see what kind of extreme things I could do or say that would not make sense to the old me.

"Got referred to a psychiatrist from my pcp. Behavioral center booked my appointment with a therapist

Got diagnosed with bipolar 2 a few weeks ago, my pcp said he didnt have the resources to properly treat so he referred me to a behavioral health center. So i've waited 5 weeks for this appointment. I was very clear while scheduling that this appointment was for seeking medication. This is the earliest appointment they could get me and it's only because they had a cancellation. Got sent the info finally today for my appointment on friday. Looked at it real quick on the portal and they've scheduled me for a telehealth session with an lpcc. I just looked it up and they cant prescribe medications. The entire fucking reason I made the appointment. 

I'm absolutely gutted. The amount of effort and energy it took me just to schedule the appointment with my pcp to get a referral (because everyone i called said i needed that) was astounding. I finally got the gumption to take hold of this shit and try to get better and this is what I get. I literally feel so defeated and like theres absolutely no point at all. I just came down from a hypo week and the depression is hitting hard and then i find this out. The rage and sadness I feel is literally making me physically ill and i feel like I could break all of my fucking fingers. 

I'm sure someone is going to comment and tell me to check myself into a facility for inpatient care. I cant fucking afford to. I have 100$ in my bank account and payday isnt for another week. I cant take any time off work because I will literally not make my mortgage payment. 

I'm sure some people really benefit from therapy and maybe at a later point in my recovery from this shit I'll be more open to it but right now all I can think is how the FUCK is talking to some stranger on the phone about my problems and them saying some stupid shit like ""oh i can hear how difficult this is for you, try these excersizes the next time you feel like you're getting unmanageable"" going to fix anything. I want to be fucking medicated. I want to get to the point where I can act or feel like halfway of a part of a normal fucking human being and maybe then i can focus on miss linda's breathing therapy.

"After six months of struggling, I finally felt like I got my depression under control. However, lately my mood has been faltering due to how lonely I am. It’s a type of loneliness I’ve never felt before; it’s so bad it physically hurts. I can’t find the words to explain the intensity of it. It hurts so bad. 

I can genuinely say I have only one friend, and she lives halfway across the world. I live with my parents while I attend college. I have to take online classes so the only time I really leave my house is to go to a coffeeshop a couple days a week. I don’t have a driver’s license due to crippling anxiety (I’m working on getting it), so even if I did have friends, I wouldn’t be able to see them often. So I have no one. No one to talk to besides my parents, and that’s just mostly superficial stuff.

"Okay so around this time last year I went on Seroquel IR due to unable to sleep and depressive symptoms. That shit rocked me and I couldn’t handle being a zombie 16 hours a day.

The constant hunger that can’t be ignored, so hard to wake up at in the AM ect.

I've sought sexual relationships (mainly sexting) with others, been emotionally abusive, and quite manipulative. This was primarily during times before I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and on a solid medication/therapy regiment. Now, I feel like I am the partner they need.

Howerve, and here's the rub, I have a sinking suspicion she is not the partner I need. She isn't supportive anymore and is somewhat condescending. She is constantly reminding me of all the past pain I have caused, and when I bring up that it was in the past she just says that I am not taking responsibility for that pain. Recently, she has gone so far as to comment on my appearance, calling my beard pubes and asking me to shave so she can find me attractive again. She brags to others that she got me to shave and belittles me in front of friends. She fights with me anytime I bring up a change that I wish to see in the relationship. She has commented on my weight. SHe has commented on my ability to be a father. She has accused me of having inappropriate emotional relationships with friends. 

I am honestly not sure if deserve this. I did emotionally cheat on her. I have verbally accosted her. I have been mean, aggressive, and manipulative in my own. These actions are mainly when I am manic and being confronted. I become incredibly defensive, to the point that I will be this way.

I know the relationship sick and that we need to speak with a couples counselor, but I am afraid that my partner will just listen and not change. Now, she used to be quite supportive.

I'm in a job that often triggers me for various reasons. I've been in a almost constant depressive episode for the past almost two months. The exception is some hours of natural ease/happiness from spending time with a few nonjudgmental friends throughout that time. My work performance has tanked and it's becoming an issue. I have coworkers talking to my boss about it, and I don't blame them, but my boss is trying to be nice about it to a degree that makes me worry that I'm taking his reputation.

I will be doing an out-patient treatment program in the next few weeks. I am already on intermittent FMLA, but the current plan (which i do not like much) is to do part-time work in the afternoons at my current job while i do the program in the mornings.

I just had an anxiety attack after getting a phonecall from my boss to talk about it. I feel like the end is near, but my boss and a few coworkers are still trying to be on my side and I see that. However, i need to leave sooner or later. I used references to get this job (I've been in it for just under a year) that were absolutely glowing from people I respect. Quitting is embarrassing for me and I wonder how much it will reflect on them. I don't feel comfortable using them as references any more. I have a long job history on my resume, with a new job about every three years. But i think it will look weird if i don't use anyone from those jobs as references.

My main question is:
Assuming I don't have references, how do I find a job? 

I'm 30, I live alone because I have a hard time with roommates. I know i can be ""the problem,"" but I always try to resolve any conflict and the older I've gotten the better I've gotten, but I also am in a difficult place emotionally and am having a hard time focusing and functioning. I feel like I'm at the edge and yet there's a light at the end of the tunnel of treatment if i can just figure out how to do this job a little bit longer and find something else that can help me keep my home and continue my medications and therapy.

"I’ve been struggling a bit recently. 33F, diagnosed bipolar (type unspecified) 4 years ago.

I have a clear history of depression going back to high school that I don’t dispute. I was diagnosed ADHD as an elementary schooler and again in high school (good student but disruptive in class, incessant talker, impulse control issues, highly unmotivated unless I’m interested in the subject, object permanence issues that persist today), medicated for it on and off, was prescribed a variety of medications and responded best to Adderall, but I also have a touch of anxiety so dosing was finicky. Treating the ADHD diagnosis yielded some progress, but never addressed all of my issues. I was medicated for depression at various times with similar results, but notably* was never treated for both diagnoses at the same time. (Edited a typo.)

Four years ago I was unmedicated and my depression was the worst it had ever been. I started seeing a new psychiatrist, pried a bit into my family medical history (both ADHD and bipolar appear), and got a bipolar diagnosis. I’ve been on Trileptal and Wellbutrin since then, and like before, I feel a little better than I did before the meds, but the issues aren’t addressed. My symptoms are mixed, and I feel some degree of symptomatic (obviously good days and bad ones) every single day. My manic symptoms consistently spike in conjunction with anxiety flare ups, which are always traceable to a trigger.

My sister (28F) is diagnosed with depression and ADHD and, when she describes how the combination affects her, it matches up to my constant mixed symptoms to a T. I’ve started to wonder if I haven’t been going at my mental health the wrong way, and I’m extremely anxious about bringing it up to my doctor for fear of sounding manic. I don’t think that I’m healed or no longer in need of meds, and I don’t plan on taking myself off of them. I also don’t plan on asking for stimulants; I’m open to any treatment plan deemed a fit. But I have a lot of concern that I won’t be taken seriously.

Has anyone been through anything like this? To be clear, I’m not asking for commentary on a diagnosis! Just seeking advice for broaching this subject with my doctor. Part of me wonders if I might be best off trying to connect with a new one; I’ve raised concerns about my meds not being effective numerous times in the past and haven’t really felt heard. But then I worry about the appearance of doctor shopping, and again, I’m not actively seeking stimulants.

"Okay, so 2 years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, and at the time I was like, ""this doesn't sound right, but I guess I'll go with it."" I was put on lamotrigene after a 20 minute appointment with my psychiatrist where, with some vague descriptions of what my highs and lows were, he decided it was a solid diagnosis. But the thing is, he never asked for specifics about what they were like, just generally if I experienced them.

The highs of my 'mania' would last about 1-3 months at a time, and usually consisted of me being very active and upbeat, but I never exactly had any risky behaviors associated with it. I've never had periods of hypersexuality, or completely upended my life on a whim or anything extreme like that. I can get irritable, and my impulse control has never been great, but I've never felt like my thoughts were racing or anything like that. 

Probably the most 'extreme' thing I've ever done was to move to a different state after a 5 year relationship that I felt trapped in ended. I just needed a fresh start from it and I got that before moving back home with a better perspective (albeit in the middle of a depressive episode).

In fact, the only really concerning thing I ever had going on were intense periods of depression (also lasting between 1 and 3 months at a time). I would have a hard time getting myself motivated to do basic tasks and my interest in things I enjoyed waned during those times to pretty much nothing. 

Being put on meds, I was just coming out of a long funk and, after starting lamotrigene, it never really felt like that funk ended. I still have problems motivating myself to do basic things, even 2 years in, and I constantly feel like I'm lagging and forcing myself to do everything and I hate it. During my up periods I used to actually workout and be active and would write and take my son to the park and be an active and eager participant in family activities. But since being medicated I don't have any of that. I'm gaining weight and have zero motivation to do anything about it despite being miserable because of it, being an active parent feels like a chore, and I can't write to save my life. 

I feel like I'm a totally different person, and I don't want to be this way anymore. I think I might have been misdiagnosed, but idk how to broach this with my psychiatrist (I feel like he barely listens to me). If anything my symptoms are much closer to that of ADHD or MDD just applying my lived experiences to them, but when I tried to bring up ADHD he kind of handwaved it away saying that adult ADHD was difficult to diagnose and left it there.

"Soon after discovering I’m bipolar I realized that it clearly affects the way I grieve. Throughout the year I was 23-24 I lost 12 people I was close to in a wide variety of ways, it was too much for my brain so I just didn’t process it. I didn’t feel like I had the time. At 26 I lost a cousin who I had greatly looked up to and I still wasn’t processing, so I started therapy which helped me move on from the then 13 deaths. This was also prior to medication. 

At this time, I am now medicated and I’m grieving a brother, a grandmother, and an aunt who all died of separate causes though two died on the same night. All in the span of February.

"**Disclaimer, not asking if I'm manic Ik im manic I just am curious on if what I think caused it is even possible**

Well it's official, my guess was correct, i know this because i've been crying for no reason and I was like oh im just dramatic, then i started getting very irritable, then paranoid, and now I feel coked up. I hate it here idk what triggered it. 

Is it possible that realllly good news could have triggered it? Cause over springbreak I got the best news that the person who sexually assaulted me got suspended from the school. And I had like this burst of euphoria because I was so happy, I stayed up for two days because I had so much energy, but other than that I don't think I had any other symptoms. Last week tuesday is when the random crying episodes began. My ex has been trying to take care of me because I would just ball for no reason and I was trying to figure out why, like i couldnt be alone or else i would start crying from anxiety and then on sunday I was so depressed I was staring off into space and wouldnt move or talk so my ex had to help me out of bed.

Yesterday I had sugar and was like hm this is a suspisuous amount of energy. Then today after I got a good critique from my proffesor I got filled with energy, then I ate food and drank water and now I have even more because when Im manic and I eat or drink water it makes the mania worse. But like seriously could good news have caused this? 

Over break I was also pretty inconsistant with meds but I was still taking them. Like I think I missed one night dose (Which I've done before and I've felt compleltly fine. I take 300mg total 200mg morning 100mg at night of lamictal, I was preparing for a depressive episode if i lost but now i'm having a mixed episode for the first time in a year which i was really happy about my winning streak against that and I havent been manic since like novemeber. 

Anyways from the way I'm typing im like 100% sure that I am and it's just been getting worse throughout the day. I need to take some hydroxizine that typically takes me down from the euphoria. Like I feel great but I hate feeling this happy and peppy and literally nausious from energy it's 3pm and I've eaten like four fried mozzarella sticks and that made me so stuffed.

"Hi... I really need a space to express myself right now. I have had a BP diagnosis for just over 8 years. I was diagnosed at 18, and I stayed medicated until I was 22. However, when I was 22 I ended up homeless due to a conflict with my mother. I was having trouble getting my medication at the time, so I eventually talked to my doctor about weaning myself off my medication. He agreed that I was handling my symptoms very well, and that we could give it a shot. All was very well for the next unmedicated 3.5 years.

However, just this year, I've been going through some noticeable changes. Starting about 6 months ago, I settled into hypomania and dealt with it rather well. However, that hypomania, for the first time ever, developed into mania. I am currently enjoying the worst depressive episode I have ever had in my life - but I'm thinking it's a mixed episode because I am also irritable and experiencing impulse control issues. 

I've heard that bipolar can become more intense as you age, but I really didn't see this coming. I thought I was one of ""the lucky ones"" whose symptoms weren't severe enough to necessitate treatment and that I could use all the tools I learned in my many years of inpatient and outpatient therapy to stay on track. I do have an intake appointment for a local psychiatric care group lined up, but, for the first time, my symptoms are so bad that I'm having trouble working and doing day-to-day tasks. I have also noticed a lapse in memory, which really scares me. I can't bear to be around people because I don't want them to see me like this. And I'm scared I'll lash out at them before I can think twice.

"Hello everyone 

First, I'm French, so sorry if my english is not perfect perfect. 

I'm 24 years old, living in Paris and apparently bipolar type 1 with intense psychotic features. 

My life was almost totally hell for several years, after my diagnosis. 

The doctors didn't correctly adjust my medication, and I already have undergo more than 2 very big  crisis. Since we have discovered that I needed neuroleptic, my life has changed for the best. 

Despite my age, I'm still in an undergraduate program at university.  In fact, my disease has caused many issues during my school and university years. I would love to become a ""documentarian"" (somebody who work in the field of documentation, information...). I want to have my first job, in the public domain, in less than two or three years. 

I have a boyfriend since 5 years, and I would love to build a life with him. He's already working since several years, so I'm eager to work, so we can ""advance"".

I would like to have a family, one or two children, and a house, in a place that we would love. 

BUT I have to be realistic. Since my diagnosis, I had more than 2 very big crisis, and many littles ones. 

I have decided since two years to perfectly take my traitement. So my life is better now. But in 2022, I had a hypomaniac and next mixte episode, which cause many problems in my study program. I'm in the obligation to do one year in two years, because I have too much delay. 

To be precise, my doctor and I had change Zyprexa to Abilify. The Abilify was at 15mg, the lithium that I take too was too low....So there was a crisis. Now, I'm hoping that the augmentation of lithium and Abilify will be relevant and protective for the years to come. 

Moreover, I decided to establish a more protective routine. I began yoga, stopped alcool...

But I really need to be stable in the years to come in order to succeed in my academics, and in my life in general.

Do you think it is possible ? Are my dreams impossible ? Do you think my stabilization in the long run is possible ?

"Hi there,
This isn't meant to be  a testimonial exactly, I'd be happy to have that someday, but for now I want to see if this is relatable to folks here. I've been diagnosed with BPD2 and am a self identifies sex addict (and video games but let's stop that list here:⁠-⁠P) [btw I have joined the SA 12-step program and sought other outlets, which are all well and good, I'm just seeking validation]

 I've been on Lamictal and Wellbutrin for a couple years now and they've been a part of my daily routine through some seriously hard times, some could argue I wouldn't be here today without them as part of my treatment. Another consistent factor is my primary coping mechanism..., since I was like 13 I've had a daily routine, a nightly ritual if you will, of masturbation and more often than not, some form of pornography. 

It dawned on me that I might be dependent on this behavior as it's a function that I literally have a handle of and gives me the otherwise nonexistent sense of predictability/reliability in my neurochemistry. Nothing beats the surge of endorphins to detach from my woes at the end of the day, followed by the subsequent oh-so-sweet fatigue and ability to sleep.

Now I don't have the capacity to get into the weeds here yet, but it's causing me issues even in a peak state of stability in my life. I want to know if other neurodivergents are experiencing similar sexual habits and their perspective, both on themselves (yourselves) and on the behavior. I'm oversleeping after late nights on screen, struggling to find peace in my love life, and craving the same power &amp; control I feel when I get my porn and orgasm. 

I have had periods of time where I stayed limited: turning of screens before bed, being open with partners about my porn usage. What I notice still is I crave the release, my body demands it or will refuse to sleep. I'm always half a thought away from overspending on sex toys or obsessively looking for ways to have sex.

I find myself over sexualizing things and ending up at a point of...well guess I'll just masturbate and coast on that feeling. Procrast-urbation is also a like a key figure in my life's behavioral history; I've masturbated and crashed out to fill the time, then woken up the moment (or long after) something was due or I need to be somewhere or do something.

For the most part I think this is one of the most welcoming communities I've ever been a part of, on so many levels, so I don't want to make it seem like this is an omnipresent problem or anything. But I've seen a couple of comments on the sub in the past few days that stigmatize other illnesses (schizophrenia and personality disorders specifically), and I just felt like I had to say something.

As a community of people with a profoundly stigmatized illness, we should know better, and we should absolutely not be adding to anybody else's burden with misinfo or stigmatizing language. A lot of us have various comorbidities, and a lot of us have schizoaffective! They deserve this space to be safe and welcoming, too. As someone who lurks on the schizophrenia reddit a lot for help with my psychotic symptoms, and who has only ever felt comforted and respected there, I feel horrified at the idea that our sub might make someone else feel anything less than welcome. 

Again, I don't want to blow anything out of proportion. But let's try to make sure we're being respectful, and not talking about other illnesses the same way people talk about ours.",Discomfort with stigmatizing language toward other illnesses,2

"I changed everything, EVERYTHING. EVERY FUCKING DETAIL OF LIFE I CHANGED. I've been to 4 different schools in the past 2 years. I've changed myself, tried to work on who I was, made myself more likable, went to the gym, and started taking care of myself. I've been to 9 different doctors, for different opinions. 7 therapists just to find one I was comfortable with. DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE FUCKING MEDICATION. I've tried Zoloft, Abilify, Lamictal, Zyprexa, Lexapro, Strattera, Prozac, Seroquel, Risperdal, Xanax, Klonopin, and Ativan. Not to even mention the ""natural"" supplements I tried out of pure desperation. IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK.

The only combination that ""worked"" for me was the olanzapine/fluoxetine combo with Lamictal as a mood stabilizer. That combination bought me a month of euthymia, A FUCKING MONTH before it started to go to shit again. My mood started to decline for NO FUCKING REASON. My life was going perfectly, BUT FOR SOME FUCKING REASON MY MOOD STARTED TO DECLINE. I decided to go off Lamictal because of the brain fog, and because it wasn't helping at that point. Eventually, I went off of olanzapine because of the fatigue. Replaced it with quetiapine but that didn't do shit. Got hospitalized because my depression was getting out of control, I went out with hope for the first time. I got discharged on January 28th, wasn't really doing well but I was hopeful, by February 8th all that hope AND MORE was crushed. Attempted suicide, and spent another 3 days at the hospital but refused to get admitted to the ward again because they were completely fucking useless. Couple of weeks later had a mixed episode because quetiapine wasn't working for me like olanzapine was. My life was completely beyond repair after the episode, completely over. Just completely over, no way it was ever getting better after that. Went back to olanzapine and here I am.

As I said, my life is over. This illness has defeated me. It's been a month and it hasn't gotten any bit better. My mood chart looks like a flat line, I haven't had a single mood that wasn't awful in the past month and a half. No one cares, people don't care that they've hurt me. Everyone has moved on, but I'm here. I don't know why I'm here, like I said, it's over. I cry myself to sleep whenever I can. I avoid almost everyone except for a few close friends who don't even know what I'm going through. I don't want to tell them because it just ruins everything. I believe all people are inherently assholes, its in our nature to be selfish. I deserve to suffer like this, not because Im me but just because im human. Every human deserves this and more. 

Even if I were to get better, I would still be awful. My doctors and I have practically given up on trying to treat my anxiety because I don't respond well to the medication(obviously SSRIs induce mania). It's over. It's over. It's over. It's fucking over",It doesn't get better,2

Thankfully we just cut down my dose so I still feel ok taking them even with the concern I already have (I have not).

I guess I'm just debating if I should wait until my appointment in mid-April or call. I've been hassling her because starting the new meds caused some nasty side effects initially but seems to have gone away. I seem okay overall, asides from this.",Paranoia coming back after switching medications,2

"One of my biggest struggles with bipolar is a constant feeling of boredom and dissatisfaction in my life. For as long as I can remember, if I'm not doing exactly what I know will make me happy (often I have 0 idea what this even is) I get this feeling in my stomach and chest that makes me feel hot, anxious, uncomfortable, and general just bad.
Sometimes I wake up from a shitty sleep, my coffee tastes like garbage, my pets are driving me nuts, I don't have anything to eat, it's cold, EVERYTHING just feels like it's wrong and sometimes this lasts for days. I struggle to keep hobbies but recognize that I can't just spend money whenever I want though it makes me feel better. Recently, I am very agitated as well. When I'm dealing with this boredom it makes me mean and snappy. I live with my partner and I love him and our life so much but some days just being in the same room as other people causes the burning in my chest and stomach.

"Does anyone ever feel like their hypomania or mania isn’t that bad, when in reality it is? I’m always questioning my diagnosis because I feel like my mania isn’t even half as bad as some things I read. Or not even close to what is portrayed on tv shows or movies. Recently it’s been getting worse, as I’ve had strong urges to do really risky stuff. For example, I had such an urge to climb up the stairs and stand and lean over the railing where a kid jumped off. And I was gonna do it to get rid of the feeling, but then I was scared that I would continue to lean and lean until I got the urge to jump off. Same thing happened when I crossed a bridge except I did end up leaning into it. But before this episode, my mania was only feeling really confident, or believing I had superpowers, or paranoia that everyone was looking at me, and my irritation was really bad.

"So this is just a rant so sorry for taking up space in the feed when other's have more serious things going on. But anyway.

However I had a pretty bad episode a couple of weeks ago and hurt myself and did some stupid stuff. Anyway, now I am waiting to be admitted into a PHP but there is a 4 week waiting list so I am just kinda floating by as I wait. I am a stay at home Dad (I am on disability), and I feel so awful because I just kinda sit here while my 1 and a half year old runs around and I put on Ms. Rachel (if you are a parent you may know who that is) and just let him do his own thing. I love my son with every ounce of my being, he is my whole world. He and my wife keep me going, keep me alive. But I just feel like I am so inadequate as a dad. I barely have the motivation or energy to fully interact with him and be the father I really want to be. Don't get me wrong I don't neglect him, I make sure he's healthy and safe, I keep my eyes on him and when he acknowledges me I give him hugs and snuggles and kisses and  he just fills my heart with joy. But I feel like I could be doing so much more to better his life, I should be sitting with him and teaching him how to speak, teaching him right from wrong, but instead I sit here on my computer listening to music and watch him run around and play with his toys because its the only thing that keeps me level and the only thing I have the mental capacity to do to get through the day before my wife gets home from work. I have no regrets being a parent even with this disorder, I just hate myself for not being more involved in his development. I know he loves me, he always runs up to me saying Dada Dada and smiles and laughs and is such a happy little dude, I just hope this program I am going to be doing will help me figure out how to regulate my emotions better so I can be more interactive and give him the best childhood he can possibly have. I want to build forts with him and run around outside and use our imaginations and go on pretend adventures. I just wish I could have the mental power to do these things and feel like a better father. And with my wife I feel like I am always dragging drama into her life. She constantly has to worry about me, hide all the knives in the house, she has to remind me how to be a human, make me shower, remind me to eat, remind me to take my meds, remind me to do things around the house etc. she is incredible and such a trooper and my savior but she deserves so much better.

I’ve recently gotten my diagnosis and the psychiatrist believed that the last hypomanic episode seemed like it was bordering mania and I’ve yet to disclose some of the following to her yet out of fear. 

When I was depressed about 19/20 years old I experienced some odd things that I brushed off for years believing I was “just depressed” and it was normal for depression. I felt consumed by this dark cloud entity in which I believed was the soul of Hitler haunting me. I believed he was going to possess me and take over or that he saw the same darkness within me and wanted to rule through me. I also heard my name once when no one was around and dark male voice rambling words I could not decipher. He was speaking but I couldn’t understand words only the noise of the voice. 

Then in 2021/2022 I experienced an episode that now we think was mania and not hypomania. I’d had a spiritual awakening and believed I had ascended to a new dimension, I would preach spirituality whilst simultaneously gatekeeping what I thought was the ultimate knowledge. I would try to link everything philosophically. I’d felt I tapped into the powers of my ancestors and was magical and was better than everyone else. I was seeing shadow people, feeling entities again, experiencing paranormal activity. I believed in so many wild theories about the universe and that I was getting messages through animals, angel numbers etc. of course the mania continued with thousands of dollars spent on rocks, completely changing my house decor, wardrobe etc to match.

I had been ruminating about this for a while, because I was freaking myself out reading about meds on the internet, and I asked him what cocktail I was on way back when I started seeing him a year and a half ago after I got discharged from the hospital. He read the list to me and I immediately started crying. It was so much. It all came back to me and I remembered how miserable it made me. 15mg olanzapine, 1200mg lithium, forgot how much effexor, along with anafranil. I was in such a terrible place for a year constantly trying to work around those meds and getting unstable anytime I tried to get off of one. I couldn't feel pleasure, I was tired all the time, lost interest in all my hobbies and in life, felt stupid and dumb and numb, lost my libido, was emotionally flatlined (my fucking grandfather died while I was on these and I felt nothing) and I felt so hopeless. I had to get a job because I took a year away from school and I sucked at it so hard because of my lethargy and my tremors.

A year and a half later, my cocktail is completely different and manageable: 250mg Lamictal, 50mg Prozac, 2.5mg olanzapine (tapering), and thinking of adding wellbutrin. but I broke down because of the regret and the time wasted and the amount of depression and numbness and pain I had to go through. Weren't the meds supposed to make me feel better? I remember initially the previous doctor from the outpatient suggested maybe lowering the dose or switching to a different AP, but I declined and I regret that so much. I regret that I never got to give Lamictal a shot initially before I was hospitalized because I tried it for a few days and my mom thought I was getting a bad reaction. I regret that I ever took stimulants or smoked or that this pandemic ever happened or that I made the stupid mistake that led to the trauma which all collectively resulted in my episode.

I want to move forward, but I still feel like I'll never get back who I was all those years ago. My psych said that the brain is constantly changing and growing and healing. But I want my old brain back, I don't care about it growing, I want to feel what I used to feel. I broke down right after the session ended really hard and my dad talked me through it.

"TL;DR: I'm in a much better place and decided to make it a day of celebration instead of a sad anniversary.

Here's a lengthy post I wrote on my socials in regard to my attempt up to now and other sentiments.


Today is the one-year anniversary of my last suicide attempt. 

It was traumatic enough the first time but nothing compared to the second time. I had a quicker and easier recovery after the first attempt, but I was completely broken on this day last year. But I’m happy to report that since that day I am (mostly) whole again. I say mostly because there are still things I’m working on and I still deal with symptoms of PTSD from it and there are things I’m still heartbroken about, but I’m still here and continuing to improve.

I’ve made a lot of strides and changes since then. One of the biggest and most important changes I made was choosing to leave my psychiatrist and therapist, both of whom I had been seeing for 10 years. It wasn’t an easy decision, and in some ways, it was just as frightening as the state of mind I had been in. Up to that point, they were the only mental health professionals I had ever worked with aside from one counselor I briefly saw at the college I attended. It was hard enough to find doctors I was comfortable with the first time and to find someone else after 10 years felt like leaving a part of myself behind. Obviously, their treatment wasn’t working for me any longer and in fact, was only worsening the condition I was in so the change was imperative. 

It is easily one of the best decisions I have ever made and I would make that decision again a trillion times over. The psychiatrist and therapists I have now are phenomenal, I couldn’t be happier to have them, and I am eternally grateful to have them. All three of them were recommended to me by the wonderful therapist I had during my IOP, who I am also eternally grateful to have had. If you feel your doctors aren’t helping don’t wait to find ones that will.

When I posted about my hospitalization and IOP last year I mentioned how my fellow patients and group members were just as instrumental in my recovery as my mental health care professionals and my family/friends, and that is still true now. I have been in a DBT group since last June and each group member (past and present) has helped me heal as much as anyone, whether they’re aware of it or not (of course I try to tell them that). By the way, DBT is awesome and there are so many aspects of it that everyone could benefit from, mentally ill or not.

Over the past year, I’ve strengthened parts of me that needed work. I changed things and reframed ways of thinking that were detrimental. I discovered new parts of myself. I broke down the walls I had built. I strengthened the parts of me that needed work. I’ve established boundaries and have stuck to them. I’ve opened up more. I now allow myself to feel my emotions instead of fighting them or bottling them up. I have stopped putting myself last. Most importantly, I have found myself again.

Of course, I didn’t do any of this alone. I’ve been lucky enough to have a ton of support. I have great bosses and a work family that supported me from when my struggles started, when I was going through recovery, my time away from work, who welcomed me back with open arms when I returned to work, and who still support me daily. I already mentioned the support from my fellow patients and group members who I will never forget. The health professionals both when I was inpatient and during my IOP. My amazing therapists and psychiatrist. My friends who I’d die for whether I see them frequently or not. I’ve been blessed with wonderful family members, wonderful in-laws, my brothers who I love, amazing parents, and of course an angel of a wife. I owe them everything, and I owe them everything. I also owe myself for allowing them to help me and for working my ass off to heal and improve.

If you’re still here after the struggles you’ve endured, you owe yourself too.

Instead of letting this be a sad anniversary I’ve decided to look at it positively and celebrate it. I will celebrate the small wins as much as the big wins. I will celebrate the positive changes and progress I’ve made. Instead of mourning what I left behind and who I was, I will celebrate what I’ve gained and who I’ve become. Instead of mourning the past, I will celebrate the present and the future. Most importantly I will celebrate that I am still here.

If you’re struggling, don't struggle alone. You are not alone and you will be surprised how many people want to help you. Keep fighting and be proud of yourself for still being here today. I’m happy you’re still here.",Yesterday was the one-year anniversary of my last suicide attempt.,2

I have read quite a few posts that talked about how their doctor told them that they might be admitted as involuntary if they didn't go in voluntarily.  But didn't they just change it to Involuntary once you were at the hospital?  Whenever I have gone to the ER willingly, the moment the ER doctor interviews me I immediately get formed. Even when I was willing to stay voluntarily, I was always admitted as an involuntary patient.

anyway, before the date i sent a friendly but firm text that i didnt want to do anything physical, not even kiss. he said he would respect that, and he did. at the end i even tried, i said i wanted to kiss him when we parted. he said he wanted to kiss me too but we should wait for the right time.

I can't get over the mistakes I've made and the resentments that I have.  I'm paralyzed with fear.

"I am 37F. I have had two severe psychotic manic episodes in the last two years.  Both times, I was on Zoloft.

For the first one in summer 2021, the pharmacy messed up my Zoloft dose and I was taking 1.5 times as much as I should’ve been.  It was a euphoric mania, and it occurred during a period of extreme stress from a divorce as well. I also started taking a 5-htp supplement around the time of my episode. I was hospitalized. I was also on lamotrigine at the time. 

I gained a ton of weight from both the antipsychotics and lithium. I went off antipsychotic first, seroquel, that caused me to gain around a pound every single day. Lithium I stayed on longer but I gained around 5 pounds a month. 

I then fell into a severe depression.  Like unbelievably severe. I thought I had had severe depressive episodes before, but I was wrong. I was not functional and planning my suicide. My psychiatrist initially refused to prescribe an SSRI, or put me on vyvanse, what I used to take for adhd and also helped with depression. I eventually talked him into it, I can’t remember exactly how.  I was also on lamotragine I think I would’ve died if I had not been out on Zoloft at that time. But it was a lower dose. 

Fast forward, during a time of work stress maybe 6 months later, I slipped into a more agitated mania. I was also on lamotrigine.  I was again hospitalized, stopped taking Zoloft and vyvanse, and went on Zyprexa and lithium. 

Weight gain with Zyprexa was still significant but leveled out relatively quickly, and lithium doesn’t seem to be an issue this time.

After writing a book, I guess my main question is- does anybody here only go manic on SSRIs?  In the past the one other time I was on one it caused rapid mood cycling, and so did Zoloft until I was on lamotrigine. I’ve been labeled as bipolar I, which I initially  talked him out of and he changed it to not otherwise specified, until I had my second one. I’ve been told the average age for first mania for a woman is 31, and I was 35.  But I don’t think it was a coincidence they were both on Zoloft. I am pretty convinced I won’t go manic without Zoloft or another SSRI. But I can’t afford to take the risk. Which means I’m stuck on meds I may not need for basically forever.

"Sorry this post is a huge mess. I just need to let everything out and I don't know who to go to right now who would understand my situation. 

So I'm 17 (got diagnosed on my birthday, quick fun fact I guess lol) and moved out of my parent's into an entirely different state back in January. I was doing completely fine, and actually felt on top of the world for awhile. I did some exams that allowed me to graduate early before moving, told myself and everyone I'll get a new job and start college as soon as I can. I haven't been able to get a job here yet, so I have been doing commissions to hold me off for a while. I was doing really good with that, making about $80-200 a week which held me off pretty well (I'm living with my boyfriend who lives with his mom so I don't have to pay rent or anything, just need to buy stuff for myself and my cat) everything was going good. 

I had to stop my meds after I moved because my psychiatrist isn't licensed in this state plus the side effects for the meds I was currently on gave me really bad tardive dyskinesia. My boyfriend's mom has been pressuring me more and more recently to get a job, sending me links for places to apply to more, and I've been applying to them. The other night I had a conversation with my parents (I'm still on good terms with them) and my mom noticed I must be manic because I told her I've been unable to get much sleep at all due to my mind constantly racing. She said she wants me to come visit home asap because she has bipolar too and based on her experience she doesn't want me being unmedicated and manic in an entirely different state especially when the depression comes. 

I told my boyfriend's mom this and she was really disappointed, saying that she doesn't want me to constantly visit back and forth again (before I moved I would visit for a couple weeks very often) and that I'm supposed to have a job by now, and that basically if I'm going to be doing this I should just move back until Im 18. I seriously don't want to move back though. I love my parents and everything and I want to just visit, not move back entirely. I'm happier here with my boyfriend, finally have myself settled and comfortable here, and I'm worried if I move back I'll get addicted to bad habits again because my mental health was a lot worse there. 

My parents and my boyfriend's mom had a whole dispute and I was in the middle of it, and since then I just feel like it triggered something in me and now I feel miserable and sick and scared. I'm sleeping constantly, and when I wake up I have messages from my boyfriend's mom telling me to apply to some place, along with messages from my parents asking when I'll be visiting. I don't want to disappoint or upset either of them with what I do and I don't know what'll be best for me, staying here and getting a job or risking it and going back to get my mental health worked on. I haven't been able to draw much at all since then and I fell behind on my commissions which is making me feel worse and I just don't know what to do right now. I feel stuck and I just want to cry and sleep and ignore all these issues. I haven't felt this shitty in so long, I can't bring myself to do anything and I keep suddenly crying several times a day when I'm awake.

Sorry if this issue seems trivial or anything. I just have an extreme fear of disappointing people which makes this all so much worse for me. I really want to visit my parents and get on something that'll help me, but I'm worried that if I go my boyfriend's mom won't allow me to come back, and I don't want to upset her with my decision since she keeps telling me to apply to the places she's sending me and I'm telling her I will so she won't get upset.

When I’m depressed I am in contact with my feelings, I’m completely focused on what’s happening inside of me instead of outside of me 2.

I've been at my new job for a little more than a year now, and I'm starting to relax around people. I'm more comfortable. And more comfortable means losing my filter slowly. I surprise myself with my reactions that are out of proportion, and it surprises people whom have known me as someone really silent. 

My personality? I talk A LOT. I can be very insensitive and agressive. I WILL do everything I need to be better than whoever is around me. I want to be prettier, the nicest, the funniest, the sweetest, the most intelligent. But that takes constant control. So when I lose it, I go fucking rogue. 

I have a VERY hard time controlling what I say cause my impulse control is absolutely shit. I don't know what to do. Cause that's when people start to lose respect toward me.

I used to think that everyone else I knew was lame. I would come up with excuses for them; “they didn’t go to a party college, they’re married, they don’t like techno music.” But ultimately, I would get mad that my friends couldn’t handle social interactions the same way I did. Turns out, everyone I know is just normal and I am bipolar.

Throughout undergrad and graduate school, I normalized my actions as part of the college experience. I still did well in school while partying and sleeping around, so why worry? Promiscuity and drinking is part of college culture, so what if I was a bit extra every now and then?

Recently though, my disease has gotten the best of me. The thoughts in my head won’t go away. I sit there in turmoil knowing that I am being unreasonable, but I am plagued by insecurity, fear of missing out, irritability, anxiety, and no matter how I try to reason through them, they disrupt my life. 

There is such a stigma on not only bipolar disorder, but mental disorders in general that it has made me afraid to try medication. Why can’t I be the way I used to be without medication? Why can’t I feel like myself without taking an antipsychotic? I know we all need a little extra help sometime, but I am scared. I am scared to admit who I really am.",Wanting to be Normal,2
"I’m trying to reconcile whether or not what I’m experiencing is psychosis. 

I do not believe in ghosts. But I found a can of reduced sodium soup in my cabinet and there is no way my roommate or I would ever buy that. We both have POTS and are on high sodium diets. I got this deep seated feeling that either someone broke in and put it there or, more likely, there is some sort of supernatural shit going on and I’m being haunted. I know rationally that this isn’t true. But I still feel anxiety in my gut that I’m being haunted and bad shit is going to happen. 

This is a pattern, I tend to get really emotional about some conspiracy or something supernatural. One time I salt lined my friend’s apartment because someone left a creepy doll in the vestibule of her building and then it got moved to the laundry room.

"There are emotions that come along with this diagnosis that get swept under the rug of summarization. It’s more than just being happy one day and sad the next. There’s the frustration of not being able to get out of bed because you’re frozen by deep, dark depression.

The sadness is so consuming, you don’t think you’ll make it one more day. There is the anguish of not being able to be reliable every single time you’re needed.
Some days I can’t count on myself, let alone be there for another person asking me for help. I wish with all of my might that I could be someone’s rock, even though I can’t be one for myself.

The lack of hope that one day it will get better and I will be strong enough to conquer this. The feelings of anger and irritation pulsing through my body for no apparent reason. My aggression toward everyone, even though I know they have done nothing wrong. The grief I feel when the thoughts come rushing in, telling me I am a burden to others and everyone who once loved me.

So you know I (F22) have the best psychiatrist I could wish for and the best treatment.
I finally am able to be happy, because my disorder was type 2 focusing on depression, I was struggling with depression from 5 to 21 years old, thought there was no way out.

"So, I started my mental health journey at the age of 20. I was initially diagnosed Bipolar 2, and tried a number of medications that either didn’t work, or made me worse.

The bad experience with medication caused me to “take a break” from medication, off and on. 

Around the age of 25 I was hospitalized for a manic episode. A year later, when I was 26, I was hospitalized again for another manic episode.

Finally, around the age of 27, I started seeing a new psychiatrist, and she put me on Abilify, and to my surprise, I finally felt stable, happy, and “normal”.

Over the years, I have had to adjust my Abilify every now and again, but can usually get stable fairly quickly.

Until now. 

I began having hypomanic symptoms about a week ago, so we raised my Abilify to 30MGS and added 5MGS of Zyprexa.

Maybe I’m being impatient, it’s only been two days, but I’m still having hypomanic symptoms. And on top of that, I’m having balance and coordination issues.

My fear is that the Abilify is no longer working, and I am accepting the possibility that I may have to start from square one.

Which means medication trial and error, and with my past bad experiences with medication, I may be completely dysfunctional for God knows how long.

Which leads me to considering possibly going on Disability. I know it’s not easy to get, and could take up to a year to receive benefits, which is a concern.

I also feel going on Disability may lower my self esteem. To be clear, I don’t judge others that are on it who really need it. It’s just a personal issue I have, I really want to work and function in the real world.

And I know you also have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get Disability, and even when I’m “stable” I tend to give up easily.

I got off of and had really bad withdrawal from lorazepam but it helps my major panic issues. So I’d keep that but use it sparingly.

My husband said he’d seriously consider divorcing me if I go off of my meds. I’m kind of devastated. We were together before I got diagnosed and medicated.

I was first diagnosed with bipolar type 2 in 2019. I quickly got stable with medication until I was pregnant in 2021 and my meds were changed. It set me spiralling and I saw a new psychiatrist who again diagnosed bipolar type 2.

I’ve been labeled a “genius”with a 140+ iq for my entire life and now I can’t do basic math. I’m freaking out, it’s so bad I might actually flunk out of school at this rate.

I’ve been on lamictal for years and always knew it made my memory and cognition worse, but it never was that big of a problem because I wasn’t doing anything that hard.

All of that changed this year when I went back to studying computer science in college, something that I was always good at. But now I can’t do anything, and I mean that.

"I’ve just been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder and it was kinda like everything was closing in on me but it also made so much sense. My next appointment for my psychiatrist isn’t for another 3 weeks (she’s also very booked out) but I will be talking to her about what I’m saying here :) 

My psych started me on 10mg of Abilify. I started taking it and felt so jittery and just down right awful. I couldn’t stand up in the shower, I couldn’t do my makeup or get dressed. I also didn’t feel like it would be safe for me to drive. It was hell.  

I took 10mg for 5 days. I went to the chemist that we see very regularly to pick up our prescriptions and she said I am experiencing akathisia. Her advice was to write it down and see if it gets any worse, and if it did, to email my psychiatrist or get into contact with her some way. 

I kind of took it my own way and just started taking half of the pills, and guess what? Akathisia is only half as bad now. 
I’ve been taking the half tablets for maybe 5 days? So 9 days on Abilify so far. It’s still horrible but I’d never want to feel that way again. It was so bad. 

I know Abilify is not the right medication for me. The benefits for me are : less racing thoughts, more stable mood. 

The disadvantages of Abilify for me are: not helping sleep at all (this has been a huge issue for years), feeling kinda “weird” and not myself around my friends etc. losing interest in a lot of creative things I used to love. And of course, the akathisia. 

I am scared of a few “bipolar meds” because I’m scared of gaining weight now that I am at a healthy weight. Just thought I’d add that in there. 

This is kind of a vent, and I know finding the perfect or best combination of medication isn’t easy and takes time but I’d love to hear everyone’s experiences with different medications :)",Just been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder and Abilify has been a real pain…,2

EDIT: Thanks again for all of the advice. I know that my husband just doesn’t understand and needs to educate himself more on this illness. A little backstory on me- I grew up with a bipolar-schizoaffective mother who really was out of control. No stability. Ever. She ended up killing herself when I was 16. I was first medicated and diagnosed at 13 and always felt my mother almost pushed me into a diagnosis. I was medicated until she died. Then not again until 2019 at 25 years old in the midst of a terribly toxic relationship. This man lied to me about everything, forced me to go get medicated only to use it against me and gaslight me into thinking I was crazy. I found a good med combo and met my husband in 2020. I was still emotionally shattered from previous relationship. But my husband stuck by me. When I say he pushed me- I don’t mean he made me or asked me. He did make comments and suggestions. I think he is just afraid the meds are going to damage me more in other ways, idk. Since being off meds I’ve held down a great job, but I’ve never had an issue working anyways. I think because I’m not like my mother was, to the same extent, I think I can do it without the meds. But lately I feel like I can’t. My work is suffering now bc I can’t focus. My relationship is suffering because I can’t open up and be vulnerable anymore. Just feels like a spiral and I don’t like that. I’ve always prided myself for my resilience but it’s come with a lot of suffering, self hatred and pain. So yeah. 

Thank you all again.

————-
When my husband and I first got together I was medicated and mostly stable. He is very natural and pushed me to try life without meds, so I did. And for the most part- I’m doing okay but I struggle occasionally. Especially lately due to family issues and work. I am the agitated type when manic and everything annoys me. I’m also very sensitive so any criticism really pushes me. Anyways- I have a had a few drinks and when I drink all my stifled emotions bubble to the surface. And my husband is a very logical, type a person. He doesn’t get it and I don’t know that he really wants to. I have really suppressed a huge part of who I am in order to stay “normal” but I feel like I can’t do it much longer. How can I let my guard down with my husband and let him know who I really am deep down? I know he loves me but we are two totally different ppl who have lived very different lives. I feel like a big part of me is missing since I’ve been holding all of my darkness in… I’m ok with my darkness and I need to feel those things but it’s been so long that I forgot how to deal with it. I kind of have been considering getting back on meds, but I’m afraid to tell him. Please give me any advice you may have. Thank you.","Unmedicated going on a year now, recently married and losing my fucking mind.",2
"So I found out I was bipolar by looking it up because it popped in my head one day and ADHD didn't explain everything. So I did that, realized it matched perfectly, talked to my psych, and it turned out he already thought I had a mood disorder but didn't know which one. I had never brought up the manic feelings I got where I'd just be really confident and happy for no reason, kind of like not giving a shit about what anyone thought and then having a million ideas, thinking how I'm gonna improve my life, also wasting a ton of money on games because in those moments my mind just goes do it who cares. I never told him about these feelings because I thought it was normal. I've always thought how I felt emotions was completely normal because I thought everyone had no control over them and because it was normal for me I had never known any difference. I know for a fact that I'm bipolar and I'm diagnosed but it still feels like pepple think I'm lying for no reason or like no one believes me. I'm not lying about how I feel and my symptoms but it feels like everyone thinks I am because what they say is how did no one find out about it until now. I never talked about it because I thought it was normal. I only started talking about it when I said I feel like only sometimes I'm lucid and other times I have no control over how I feel. Like it feels like I only swim to the surface once in a while and then I'm dragged back under into depression and mania, rapidly cycling between the two. It feels like after my diagnosis I started cycling more and more rapidly? Like I've kind of lost any semblance of control I had left I guess. Like I feel manic when I'm depressed or vice versa. It's scary because it feels like I'm having more frequent mood swings, like 3-4 times daily. I don't know if they're actually more frequent or I'm just realizing that I'm having mood swings because I never recognized them before.

I’ve been having a hard time with work recently. After finding this community I’ve discovered that I’m not the only one with trouble holding down a job. 

I have a relatively high paying job for my area that allows me to live at least paycheck to paycheck with one pay period worth in my savings. I guess I don’t really know where to start, but I just can’t work my job anymore. I have this horrible depression and the job itself is very difficult. I have FMLA for my mental health and can take up to 2 days off per week and also have time off for appointments. I’m finding myself needing more and more time off, unpaid, and I don’t know what to do.

I applied for a much lower paying job, but I feel like it will be much better for my mental health.

"43 F, was diagnosed with BP II at 34 years old. My parents definitely both have some type of undiagnosed mood disorders but Bipolar runs rampant on my father’s side.

Currently taking 375mg Lamictal (extra 100 added because I use the Nuvaring), 900mg lithium, and 300mg of gabapentin. I had a pretty bad alcohol issue prior to January. I realized I went into mixed episodes when I mixed lithium and wine. So I switched to Whiteclaw and had no issues and now I just have not been drinking much. Like an idiot I was feeling relaxed the other night and thought it would be nice to have some wine to further calm down. Just had a glass. Last night, I drank the rest, and started getting super hopeless.

My issues with bipolar lead to my husband telling me he wanted a divorce 2 months ago. I was struggling a lot in the second half of 2022. I was weaned off Lexapro after taking it for 8 years. Historically, i do not do well in periods of adjusting meds. I was getting better by early January as I stopped drinking wine. But then the divorce happened (not officially but no chance of reconciliation).

My kids (13 and 15) knew he wanted a divorce before I did. They thought it was a good idea because of all of the fighting. My 13 year old still spends time with me but my 15 year old doesn’t even like being around me. I love spending time with them, and it’s the only thing that makes me remotely happy at the moment but they are just not that into it, which makes me less happy.

I literally am so miserable. The only thing that I like doing is going to concerts. So I bought four concert tickets for shows over the next two months. I just don’t know how I can sustain being so depressed. I am a mid-level practitioner in a profession I can’t get out of because of a bias/ stigma against. I hate my job and it’s actually physically injuring me. I’m in $400K+ student loan debt ($120K being the actual loan, the rest as interest). I wasn’t aware that I had bipolar when I started professional college. My career requires an entrepreneurial mindset and this motivation fluctuates. I’ve tried applying for jobs outside of my profession but I know I’m qualified for and I am always rejected or looked over.

I have no family or friends closer than 1000 miles that actually care about me. Just online friends. I live in a very expensive city near where my husband is from and cannot leave.

"The past few months I've been struggling with persistent suicide ideation and even attempted during a major depressive episode. But instead of saying ""it's just a symptom of your disease"" I would like to walk you through my thought process. 

1. The argument from circumstance. 
Right now I am unemployed, with no realistic chance of getting a job. My resume is spotty, and the market I operated in pretty much collapsed. My memory, focus and cognitive skills are pretty much gone after having two psychoses in a year. A low skilled job almost always requires a drivers license, which I'm not capable of (I tried). Furthermore, I have a criminal record from the things I did during my psychosis, excluding me from most jobs in my field anyways. I'm lonely and have no support system (no friends or family that can offer any stability). Meaning that within a year or so I'll be forced to sell my house and eventually live on the streets. Homelessness is not a reason for suicide of course, nor is unemployment, but it's also something I'd rather not do. Yet it is almost unavoidable. 

2. The argument from harm. 
My actions, whether in psychosis, depression, mania, anger, or just because who I am, have caused irreparable emotional and material damage. My continued existence is a danger to society, and will always incur tremendous cost (through health care, living on the streets, and I've had multiple encounters with the police during both manic and depressive episodes). While one could argue that all life is ultimately detrimental, in my case it's fairly obvious: I cause harm without being able to effectively control it, and I do not wish to cause any more harm. The self image of a calm collected person is a fever dream, in reality I'm just a unstable criminally psychotic mental health patient. 

3. The argument from hopelessness.
You might argue ""well maybe you'll find a job, some friends, maybe even love, and what you did in the past might not happen again"". Living on the streets is an adventure! Unfortunately, it might also not be the case. I've always had a pessimistic and depressed outlook, and whether that is caused by brain abnormalities or not almost seems irrelevant: life has always been a struggle, and I do not want to continue this struggle. It's hopeless, really, I just kinda fumbled my way into an impossible situation. 

4. The argument from despair. 
Although perhaps a majority of people disagrees with the following: I believe society is on the brink of collapse, and within our projected lifetimes things will likely only get worse. Without going into the precise reasons for believing this, I feel like it's almost uncontroversial to say ""things are bad, and they'll get worse"". For the longest time I held a certain morbid curiosity for this ""lets see how this plays out"", but after my depressive psychosis (which was a traumatizing hell) I quite simply no longer have the desire to see it. 

5. The argument from meaning. 
Commonly the argument against suicide goes ""what about the people you leave behind"". The two people I still have in my life pretty much said ""we get it, just make sure your affairs are in order"". So that's not a real argument for me personally. But in the abstract you might say ""you owe it to the world to do your best"" to which my mind always replies ""no"". I have nothing to contribute anyways, but if life is simply reduced to doing the meaningless bidding of others in order to perpetuate some bizarre notion of ""you must work to live, even if life is miserable"" then I simply refuse to play that game. But even if it is not miserable, which it will be (because my brain is broken), is life then simply some egocentric hedonism ""find pleasure in something"". I mean that's also a little bit of a hollow existence. Someone once said to me ""life just *is*"", there is no purpose or meaning to it, which is fair. But then not living really seems like a choice, and I can choose to stop it. 

6. The argument from personality. 
Nobody likes a pseudo-intellectual climate activist with anti-capitalist tendencies that has a mental health disorder and will probably live on the streets. Especially not one that studied AI and philosophy. Especially not ... you can fill in all the stereotypes, feel free to pick the ones you hate the most. Now you might say ""just shut up then and be normal"", I quite literally can't. You can't just say ""change your personality"". I have seen so many death threats on social media, it's worrying in its own right. 

So that's it, that's the thought process. I'm just too tired, I have lived an acceptable life. I've known riches and wealth, love, and the depths of thought. But it's done. Life will always end, there is even some beauty in the idea that I get to pick when.",On suicide,2
"I got diagnosed a week ago, as Bipolar Type 2. I've talked with my psychiatrist and my therapist a ton about the diagnosis, and it's definitely really interesting to see the way so many Bipolar symptoms align with my behaviors so well, and really explain my struggles.

I'm taking medication that I'm excited about, I feel really happy that my psychiatrist and therapist both think this diagnosis is 100% accurate.

I just also feel so lost - like a part of me has been identified that has been ignored for so long. It's really strange to feel like no one has ever really questioned my behavior.

"I've been on wellbutrin for around 5 years, lamictal for three, and now am adding abilify. Wellbutrin stopped by zoloft-induced dissociative fugues, and Lamictal changed my life, tbh. I started taking it at around the same time as the first COVID lock downs, and the medication plus the chance to recognize (and indulge) my agoraphobia was huge. I used to have panic attacks and dissociative episodes every single time I tried going to grocery stores, restaurants, malls, or anywhere else crowded and overstimulating, and that's much less of an issue now. 

Three years later everything is still better, but I have a really hard time with task initiation/completion and do still have hypomanic episodes, scary intrusive thoughts, and constant suicidal ideation (that sometimes gets a little too active for comfort). I kinda thought I was doing fine, since it really is noticeably better than before, but during a recent appointment with my psychiatrist I was mentioning this and he asked if it was affecting my ability to work. I said no, but then almost immediately remembered how frequently I spend an entire day staring at my screen unable to think clearly enough to write, only to have anxiety attacks at the end of the day because I feel ‐ correctly - like I got nothing done and am bad at my job. (Logically, I know that I'm actually really good at my job, but ykwim). Then I end up working late and it compounds with everything else and I end up exhausted and can barely help with housework and things, and that then makes me feel like a terrible partner. (On the flipside, I think about how much better I feel now, and wonder how tf my partner stayed with me through all that - it'll be 8 years in a few months.)

At this point, I'm already on 400mg of lamictal and 300mg of wellbutrin, so rather than increase the dose past the point of clinical evidence, my psychiatrist suggested trying abilify.

Normally kind people will do the most apathetic things and then be confused if you ask them why they did that. Like they genuinely don’t know. 

TLDR I feel like none of this is real. Myself or others and we are all in a big simulation. I don’t feel like a real person.",TW depersonalization? Feeling like the world isn’t real,2

"i absolutely ruined my career on impulse after staying up all night drinking alone. i literally cannot believe i did this. i just got a decent job that pays amazing, and it’s gone. i cannot believe i disappointed my family like this. unbelievable.

i spent the night drinking heavily, chatting with random men (nsfw stuff) online to make me hate myself even more than i already do (i’m a lesbian, wtf???), crying hysterically for no reason, slept for one whole hour, woke up still drunk and then ended my career a few hours later when i got sober because i was 1000% convinced i was going to be fired for no reason. literally what the fuck. 

this was yesterday. i’m absolutely not coping, it hasn’t even really hit me and i’m really scared for when it does. the only reason i haven’t hurt myself as punishment is i don’t feel like i deserve even that relief. 

i’m still adjusting my meds (low doses of five meds, the plan is to consolidate and up the doses after). been struggling still with self destructive behaviors but this is so much worse than anything else i’ve ever done.

"One of the first indicators that I'm about to have an episode (manic or depressive) is I stop cleaning. It's been that way since I was a kid.My parents were afraid I'd be a hoarder. When I moved back home, I hired a cleaning lady for my parents house because I didn't want to argue with them about my bedroom after coming home from work. It was AMAZING. When I moved out I didn't have the budget for her to come to my apartment. The first year couple of years I did great, but then I started grad school during the pandemic. I got overwhelmed quickly. I had enough in my budget to hire her and it's kept me healthy! She comes every 2 weeks. That motivates me to do laundry and throw away trash so it's not in her way.

"25 year old female, diagnosed at 18 and have been taking lithium on and off. 

Well... I went off my medications again for a few months. I went off when I was done with school receiving a certificate for my future career. Well, I felt fine, as I am not working currently so don't really have any stressors. Before I went fully off my medications I was not taking them consistently and I quit one of my jobs of 4 years, started a new one (during the time I bought a house and was moving) and quit that one after a few months. The anxiety was the thing that was my problem, I was having massive panic attacks, and just had this intense self hatred for myself which then diminished my self-confidence entirely. Especially after just throwing away my life. 

Well just recently, I got a job in the career I was going to school for for so many years... and after day 1 I quit because I had a major meltdown. Could not keep food and water down, was cold sweats and shaking anxiety, it took me back to last year when I also had a similar meltdown. But this time it was so intense and different. I hate myself for quitting a professional job the next freaking day. How embarrassing, I literally threw away everything and I feel I will never be able to go back again. I now am deeply depressed and anxious. Cannot eat, keep waking up in a panic. I wish I never went off my meds, maybe I would have never quit the job and stuck it out. I don't know what my problem is. I just started my meds again, I am only on lithium ER. I am currently seeing a psych doc and I have kept her out of the dark about going off my meds and how I have been taking them so inconsistently. I also want to go on the anxiety med she recommended buspar, but I refused to try it because I thought I could beat it myself.. bipolar symptoms I have more control over. I am not sure if this is a part of bipolar or just separate generalized anxiety. 

Now everyone in my life thinks I am lazy and just don't want to work. But I do, I just keep fucking up because I won't take my meds. My boyfriend is currently paying all the bills, we just bought a house, so we are living pay check to pay check and I am afraid he will end up leaving me because of this.

"Pretty self explanatory. I was recently diagnosed by a therapist with Bipolar 1. I’ve been able to use the counseling center at my university after coming back from a year long leave of absence from my masters program (likely due to a manic episode that I hadn’t recognized as a manic episode at the time). I had initially come in with the goal to reduce my chances of burn out when I was diagnosed. She recommended I see a psychiatrist to get medicated. I’ve always been highly wary of being on medication for anything, especially long term. Long story short I left with a script for Depakote (500mg) to take once at night. I work overnights, I intern during the day and I have classes throughout the week. I fear that getting on this med will affect my productivity (can cause sleepiness/dizziness). I guess I’m still working through accepting my diagnosis. How do I go about asking for a different med that will better work for my ever-switching sleeping schedule? I haven’t even wanted to take the Depakote. Sometimes I wonder if the diagnosis is wrong and I fear messing my brain chemistry up more.",Recently diagnosed but hesitant to get medicated,2
"I've been off of lamictal for a week now after developing mild rash symptoms.

Interestingly, and unbeknownst to me, I noticed it had been changing my behavior.

Since being off, I'm less irritable, more social, and more creative/funny.

The downside is that my sleep schedule is now shit and that my swings are back to what they used to be (which isn't all that bad since my depressive swings have always been mild/moderate - it's the hypomania thats the slightly problematic one but I'm aware of when it's setting in).

Don't really know how to proceed really because the trade offs don't really seem worth it for me. I Uber so I can drive when I want and the hypomanic impulsivity isn't really something I think I can't handle. 

Should I just go back to raw-dogging life? I just wish I had normal brain chemistry. Sleep hygiene is the biggest detriment but I feel like I'm giving up too much of myself for it.",Stopped lamictal and noticed how it was affecting me,2
"I’m medicated and doing well but still get tired out and wish I had more energy and felt awake when I want to. Usually during the workweek I’m distracted enough that I don’t feel tired. On the weekends I’m consistently tired enough that I need a nap unless I’m super distracted by a task or social engagement. 

What more can I do? I go to bed at 9 or 10 pm and wake up at 6:30. I never feel rested and basically have to army-crawl out of bed. I follow every sleep hygiene tip out there (no caffeine after 2 pm, block out all light and sound) other than watching TV before bed (no phone/screen time IN bed though). 

I get a ton of exercise, at least 1 hour per day of walking my dog and walking to/from work. I also work a very physical job but it’s not my body that’s tired out, it’s sleepiness. 

I eat clean and quit eating refined sugars about 6 weeks ago. My “junkiest” food that I eat is probably sugar-free rice putting. No fried shit, no chips, no fast food, none of that. 

I also have ADHD but am not medicated for it (nothing has worked) and I’m on Seroquel but feel as tired as I did on 200 mg as I do on 100 mg. I’m sober and my only vice is vaping at the lowest concentration of nicotine.

I always think about the time between my big first episode and my 2nd one, when I was able to function perfectly fine without meds. I was happier. I didn't fall into deep depressions every few months. I didn't have mania or psychosis. Bipolar didn't really exist then. 

Is this just the price to pay for medication that will prevent a major psychosis or mania? If it is, I don't think I can keep it up.",I felt better for the 10 years I didn't take meds. Now I'm just getting depressive episodes on meds,2
"Now, don't get me wrong, I love my meds. They keep me stable and have kept me mostly stable (adjustments needed to be made) for about five years now. But sometimes it's so overwhelming having to take them.

And looking at my boyfriend, who barely needs a headache tablet once every six months, I can't help but feel annoyed that I have to deal with this 

I'm also moving countries at the end of the year, and the idea of having to find a new gp/psychiatrist who can prescribe me meds, and having to ensure I take enough meds so I have the chance to find one is also a lot to deal with, and also costly.

I kept looking at the license plates of cars passing by, and they all called to me in some way or another. I can't explain it but they all seemed to have special numbers related between them.

Yet, when I need a leave of absence, I get told my job cannot be guaranteed. The funny part is this industry has horrible job retention. Well, it’s because they pay shit and treat you like shit and make you do the job of 3-4 departments but do not increase your pay and all the roles get looped into a miscellaneous tasks section in the job description. What hurts most is the way colleagues talk about people with mental health disorders like they’re an annoying object. “This bipolar mom…” “this un medicated dad..” “if they would just take their meds”. I have been in a manic episode where I had to go home because the impulses were going to overcome my civility. Why is there no room for me? I chose this field to help. Yet no one here wants to help.

I’ve been diagnosed with BD type 1 for two years and when I got diagnosed it made so many things from my childhood make sense.
I was always so “emotional and dramatic” and known as being a “cry baby” basically my entire life. To be completely honest I truly think I’ve always been bipolar (genetically not necessarily an environmental effect-although my environment didn’t help but cause more spark to the fire) 
Anyway, I’m 27 now and I’ve decided to discontinue birth control. I currently take the pill and have the nexplanon. The combination of the two seemed to help for about five months but since having the nexplanon I have gained so much weight and have become more noticeably irritable. My episodes are more drastic and scare not only myself but others around me. Along with that my depression has gotten worse and pet of that is because of the weight of gained-it makes me so mad. I’ve tried dieting and exercising extensively. I have been told that a k eto diet helps manage symptoms of BD-not sure how true tha is. But I did do the diet for about two months and I dropped weight quick and get on top of the world. Thinking back on it now idk if that top of the world feeling was me having an episode.
I few like my BD has been managed quite well but of course I struggle day to day. 
Everyone here knows how dark bad days can be, you know how it can be. It’s scary as fuck! 
I want to be healthier with minimal medication and I feel like that means no more birth control. I’m hoping it helps me lose weight and decrease my depression. 
I also want to start a family but it worries me that my children could possibly have BD like me. No one is immune to pain and suffering but man having a mental diagnosis sure makes things a hell of a lot harder. 



Edit: the only reason I’ve taken birth control is because my cycle is extremely irregular. Sometimes I have it every day for  months at a time to having it very painfully for a day or two.

Over the past few months I've experienced my first full-blown manic episode, with all the characteristic symptoms. 

Now I'm back in a really bad depressive state. Nevertheless, I've really been treated like shit over the past few months by some people who were once friends. In the past, I'd have been very meek and mild and probably would have let such behaviour slide. But over the past month or so, I've been very confrontational about the way I've been mistreated. 

I also went to the annual general meeting of a society I used to be president of, and called them out for their causal homophobia, misogyny, racism etc. 

These are things I wouldn't have considered doing in the past - I'd have been far too anxious and frankly conflict avoidant. Now that fear has gone and I see willing to embrace confrontation when I've been wronged. 

Is this just a sign of personal growth or have others experienced a surge in confrontational behaviours as well?

Thanks guys and love to you all",Suddenly really confrontational?,2
"I had been with this girl since high school, we started a family together, 8 years into our life together she had enough of me being a stoner we had a big fight over it 

Im going to rehab to deal with some trauma linked to my sex and drug abuse problems but she’s not prepared to give me a chance to get better and support me, I never really did anything wrong she just doesn’t like weed 

I gave everything to this girl and made a lot of positive improvements over the years but she told me she can’t handle my mental illness and that she loves me but needs to focus on herself 

The fact that she is a really good nurse is tearing me up because she loves caring for people but im too much for her, it hurts to know that someone can just leave over an uncontrollable mental illness",Relationship over - I’m too crazy,2
i’ve been with my new psychiatrist for a few months now and she’s so precious like absolutely wonderful. i’ve been thinking for a while that i could be on the spectrum and i just want to know if i am definitively or not. idk how i should go about bringing it up esp since we already have a host of disorders to deal with rn. i’m kinda scared to ask for an evaluation tho cus what if she doesn’t agree or smt i just don’t want to feel uncomfortable thinking abt it is making me anxious,asking for an autism evaluation,2
"hi! first reddit post like ever i think haha. i'm 19 and was diagnosed with bipolar 1 when i was 16 after the classic ssri trigged manic episode. i am on medication and regularly attend dbt therapy both in group format and with a private therapist. treatment disclosure aside i am really just looking for anyone to use their more lived experiences as some advice for how to date while living with bd.

i know it can get better and that letting one's self get caught into the spiral of feeling like you're doomed just becomes a self fulfilling prophecy, but the constant cycle of being a guys' ""dream girl"" simply because i'm manic and down to do whatever (little does he know i only view him as an awkward sidekick until i start slipping back down into depression) only to be told i'm a little much soon as i begin feeling depressed again. there's many other questions and anxieties i have regarding letting myself be loved but that might make this post a little too long :&gt;0

on a separate note whether or not i am sad i got dumped again, i can be happy daylight savings happened and i can now relish in the extra sunlight. plus in addition to lithium i had armodafinil added to my regimen and it has helped immensely with my adhd and i am in the process of titrating lamotrigine which i am hopeful will help even more.",does dating get any easier???,2
"How are you supposed to tell somebody, be it a mental health provider or a friend to confide in, that you’d rather be dead than have to live with bipolar disorder? I’m NOT suicidal. I’m just exhausted. The help I’ve received has been minimal at best. My original diagnosis was 10+ years ago, and the treatment was and still is a joke. 

I was never the best patient, but my doctor told me that I was the bipolar poster child. 

I lived at home with my single mother, who moved to a different apartment at least once a year. She was a victim of domestic violence. The incident occurred around 2004, and this man (the abuser) played a minimal role in her life in the following 13 years. Even though he’s out of her life completely now, she will still “play the victim card”, as she’s likely consumed by thoughts of the event. That being said, she refuses to confront her trauma. She played little to no part in helping me get any help for my mental illnesses or her own. 

Due to constantly moving, when I could get any kind of professional treatment, it was never long lasting. I wasn’t able to stay in therapy/psychiatry and I surely wasn’t able to stay on a medication long enough to tell if it was beneficial or not. This led to episodes of mania and depression that then led to hospitalizations that shattered my trust in everyone. 

My mother moved out of the apartment we lived in when I was 17. From that time until I was 20, I rapidly cycled through manic, hypomanic, psychotic manic, and crippling depressive episodes with great intensity. I wasn’t able to tell where the mania ended and the depression began. I was mostly manic, which meant I didn’t need treatment because I felt like a god; completely untouchable. I got arrested, lost my job, and totaled my car. My mother had put me up in my own one-bedroom apartment. After losing my job, I didn’t have any income with which to pay my rent. I lost the apartment, too, and ended up homeless. 

I started to get back on my feet with a lot of help from friends, family, and my boyfriend at the time. I started self-medicating with cannabis and the symptoms actually started to subside for a little while. I certainly won’t say that it’s an effective treatment method for bipolar disorder because I was still cycling, but I wasn’t moving through episodes so quickly. For the past 5 years, I’ve noticed annual depressive episodes with shorter, less severe hypo/manic episodes. 

I currently have a psychiatrist whose not willing to give me anything other than Abilify and Hydroxyzine, which is basically just Benadryl, but at least it helps me sleep at night. 
I’m on the waitlist for therapy, with no openings in the next 90 days, at least. 
I have a stable job, steady income, a car, and a place to live. I try to get to the gym 3 times a week. I do yoga almost every day. Things should feel better, but they don’t. 

I’m tired of taking care of myself. I’m tired of babying my mental health. I’m tired of trying to learn about bipolar disorder on my own because nobody ever educated me about my diagnosis. I do not have it in my anymore to keep doing all of this.","To preface, this probably belongs only in a diary or in the depths of the folds in my mind… This might be a mess.",2

"Hi friends.  Newly diagnosed bipolar 2 homie. 

Long story short, after months of therapy my therapist and psychiatrist came to the conclusion 2mo ago that I have bipolar 2 and that I’ve def had manic episodes before. 

But I didn’t know they were happening so like, I don’t know if I’m having one or not? I don’t know what they’re like. Will I know I’m manic when I’m manic? 

I’m EXTREMELY energetic. I was with some friends I don’t see very often today due to long distance and I could not stop fucking talking. Like thinking about the day I’m so embarrassed. I had a date with my partner Friday night (2nd day on adderall) and he said I was completely fucking wired and I know I didn’t stop talking. Also embarrassing.

I didn’t sleep Friday night and it’s Sunday morning 2AM now. I am broke and no job rn so no bad spending habits but definite problem in the past. I did ask my best friend for money for a weird idea and she knows what’s going on with me so just said let’s talk about it next week (when I’m hopefully not probably manic). 

I just feel like I wanna do 5 million projects but all I can do when I’m by myself is scroll Reddit and like, fucking talk to myself, listen to music, Google weird things and make really long weird notes on my notes app for people. 

I can’t actually like clean my house or anything like I feel like I want to.

My doc recently put my on 5 mg Adderall for ADHD too. I’m wondering if this is affecting it this weird energy, talkativeness and sleeplessness? It’s Sunday and I started it Thursday. 

I’m just really lost and don’t know if I’m manic and what to do about it. I’m on Abilify and prozac and it’s helping me have more normal moods but like I said I still don’t know what to expect during mania and know it’s still going to happen on those meds. 

Also, how often can mania happen generally? Is this hypomania? I’m just lost and don’t know how this stuff works. No one has educated me enough on it.

"After having many manic episodes (which I tried to hide), I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. Rapid cycle. Mixed state mania. All that jazz... 

What I experience doesn't seem to be consistent with what many other people feel. Before a full blown manic episode I feel great, all my problems melt away and I hardly sleep at all. This makes sense to me. Once I pass that phase, things become very extreme. I can only describe it as absolutely excruciating, like being in hell. Like I'm on a ton of amphetamines and the most extreme anxiety I have ever experience. It never stops or takes a break. I never sleep or even sit down. All I can do is pace around my house all day and night for days on end. My heart is beats out of my chest the entire time. It breaks me and I'll do anything for relief. The last time I was manic, after taking seroquel for a few days, it brought me down to a point where I felt like I was on cocaine all the time. That I could attleat tolerate. 

Does anyone else have horrific manic experiences?? This doesn't seem to be consistent with everything I've read, and it's been bothering me for years. I'd appreciate any input. Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

On a positive note, I haven't had a manic episode for almost a year. 300mg of lamotrigine does a great job keeping me down. Vraylar was very effective as well, but the side effects were more than I could handle. I now take bupropion for depression which almost pushed me into mania once when I was on a lower dose of lamotrigine. Before I was diagnosed, prozac pushed me into the worst manic episode I had ever experienced.",Excruciating manic episodes. Is this normal?,2

"I developed a serious problem with my tobacco use last year.  I used to smoke about half a pack a day fairly reliably, but in the wake of a very stressful cross-country move, my consumption spiked to 20-25 smokes a day and I haven’t been able to get it back down yet.  I have BP1 with psychotic features and my own therapist said he doesn’t know anyone with a psychotic mood disorder that doesn’t smoke, so I’m not sure if actually quitting is in my future.  I’ve tried before using patches and after two weeks I felt like I had a rabid rat scratching around in my head.  However, I do think getting back to half a pack or less is doable.  My current plan is two-fold: replace some of my daily smokes with nicotine gum, and instead of having the whole pack with me out on the porch where I smoke, I keep them inside and only take 2 with me outside.  When I’m done I’ll set a phone timer for 2 hours and not smoke until it goes off.  Hopefully this will get me down to around 15 or less a day at which point I’ll either smoke every 3 hours or only have one at a time (perhaps both!).  My therapist is a big fan of the harm reduction method of dealing with substance use.  Yes, I know that any smoking at all is bad for me, but so is completely losing my mind and raging: it’s a balance.

Does anyone have any thoughts regarding my plan or any additional tips that may be helpful?  I’ve been smoking since I was a teenager (now 51) so it’s a deeply ingrained habit.

"Today has been one of the worst days in a long time. Out of so many countless times I have wanted to just give up and end it, I kept going. Thought I was getting a loan so I could get out of debt and actually have some money to get things I desperately need since I haven’t worked in over 5 months and have had $0 since.

"Does anyone else have this happen to them? It's very strange.

I remember maybe when I was 7 I would be confused as to if music was actually playing.

It doesn't happen too often, but it's peculiar when it does. I became more consciously aware of this when I was maybe 13. I remember being restless because I could hear music, but it was too clear for it to be real. I went outside my bed and didn't hear anything.

I was talking to my psychiatrist maybe 2 days ago about it. If you want you can take a quick scroll through my post history, but basically

1. Got sexually harassed badly from a supervisor. He told told me sexual things about my body and told me he liked sliding in and coming inside

2. When I reported it, the manager cut my hours to zero. I have to pay for rent and food, not to mention how it felt to muster up the courage to report it, and then right face retaliation. I've never experienced this kind of devastation before. I can't even describe how painful the act of retaliation in itself was. I was aware I might not be believed, but I didn't think I'd get punished.

So I told my psychiatrist about it and almost cried. I'm still processing this information, and I'm struggling. I really am.

Sometimes it's music playing. More often, actual music will be playing, and I hear an actual person singing along with the song, but they aren't. It's the most bizzare thing. I have to stare at their lips, and they won't be moving. But I hear their singing very clearly.

Has anything like this happened to others before?

But, thank God for meds. I've dipped in and out of suicidal fantasy because of it, but overall, it's been ok. I still have panic attacks when my throat closes up and I have to step away to cough it out and/or drink water. But again, thank God for meds.

"Hey everyone,

I am far from a inspirational speaker but I wanted to just hop on and say that when it comes to my BiPD I feel I am a much stronger person because of it. I grew up with a mom who likely had the disorder as well but took the path to meth as her escape and my dad was always working and never there. 

I grew up on my own and didn't find out I had the disorder till I was in my late teens. I wasn't able to go to college and I struggled to find work that was a fit and take care of myself for a bit but now I am happy to say I found the best job and make more money without a degree than most.

This IS NOT me bragging, I say all of this to show that I think we all forget sometimes that while having this disorder is a struggle it can teach us a lot of lessons. It also allows many of us to think differently and that can be a benefit. The problem is finding a way to get to stability to be able to use it in a way that doesn't make us self-destruct. I know it's hard (understatement of the year), and everyone has to find thier own path because it is definitely not one size fits all.

Hello people,

I am writing to you because I need help.

Please excuse me first of all because English is not my first language.

I am desperate, I am destroyed.

I am bipolar and borderline.

I am in a relationship with someone who was perfect for me at first and has since neglected me, disrespected me, ignored me, and blamed me for everything because of my disorder.

Before I met him, I had managed to rebuild myself, to go back to work after a 2.5 year break (I was diagnosed in 2019).

Since then, I have been living in hell.

He lived far away from me (950km/690miles) and we tried life together but that's when my disorder revealed itself.

He was constantly on the computer, talking down to me, having horrible outbursts and insulting me.

He even threatened to kill himself and jump off my balcony and I tried to hold him back and that's when I had my first ""boderline"" crisis where I started screaming in pain and wanting to end my life.

I called him parents to warn them of his actions and when they called, my boyfriend said everything was fine while I was crying in the back and they could hear me.

A lot of things happened and I asked him to go home (he lives with his parents).

Since then, it's been hot and cold between us.

One day I'm ""his Queen"", the next day he barely pays attention to me and when I criticize him for not even asking if I'm okay, he says ""because you think I'm your knight in shining armor?"" when for me it's the minimum for any social contact.

You should know that from the beginning of our relationship, I was threatened with a knife by one of his family members and insulted and while we were abroad in a remote place I didn't know.

His family consults a lot of medieums, psychics, card readers and all of them say that I am the devil and not made for their son while I have never shown anything but goodness, kindness and compassion despite what they made me go through (recently, I learned that they would be persuaded that I raped their son and that my first goal is to ""kill him"" while I have never raised my hand on someone).

They even told me while her sister wanted hut me with the knife that it was ok because ""the devil is INSIDE HER' and so it means that it's not her fault and they didn't event ask if I was fine once ?!

Last week was the worst of all, I hurt myself, I hit my head multiple times during his present and I tore my face off + hit myself with an alter because I heard his parents on the phone saying again that I was going to kill him and he did nothing to stop it and instead he left when I could have killed myself.

I am stuck in this relationship, I don't know how to get out of it.

I feel like I can't see any way out because I feel like no one will want me because I'm ""crazy"" and I don't want to live with someone like him, nor do I want to start a family with him because of the principles he may have and his family (I can't tell you everything, but the story of the knife already tells you a lot)

I need help, my caregivers don't tell me anything, they listen to me and that's it.

No one understands me.

The more I talked to him about my illness and how to help me if I was neglected, the more he did nothing.

When we lived together and he insulted me, I took it upon myself at first and went to him with a big smile and hugged him as he pushed me hard and said ""YOU DISGUST ME!"" to then tell me ""sorry, I love you more than anything, you can't even imagine, I will never leave you alone again, I will do the work for both of us as you have done for the past 7 months, everything it's over I'm not going to abandon you anymore, it's up to me to make sure that you become again the one you were before my family and I broke you"" then suddenly it's ""you're responsible for everything, it's is because you are hypersensitive""

His family hates me because I'm ""too pretty, too nice, too cuddly to be true"" when I'm just me!

I can't take it anymore, yesterday and this morning I wanted to end it, I can't tell myself that I'm going to get out of this, I can't tell myself that I'm going to manage to escape of him because I'm hooked in spite of myself and I don't know why because we no longer live together and it's a daily suffering.

He's h24 on his computer, he just plays, he has nothing to talk about, we don't share anything anymore (he was different at first, it was amazing then he showed his face when he moved in with me).

I just asked him again if we could call because I need help because I'm in pain, I'm taking xanax for the first time in my life in addition to my usual treatments when I've always managed to do without (and even with that, it doesn't work)

I'm begging you, help me, advise me, I don't know, but I need help from people who understand me.

"I feel like I’m too hard to love. I’m in my late 20s, and I have bp II. I’ve been medicated and going to therapy regularly for years but I still have mood swings etc. i thought I managed it well? I’m a lesbian and I try really hard to make relationships work but in the end I’m always too much. I even escaped an abusive one. It hurts so badly. Especially when i think about the fact that in multiple relationships, when my partners were going through their depressions (not bipolar but reg depression) I held them down, to the point of putting their needs and feelings above my own and neglecting myself (which I now know is unhealthy). And then they get better..But the second I start struggling I’m “too much” and they don’t know if they can do it. It’s frustrating because I’m really upfront about the fact that I have bp II and they’ll say it doesn’t matter etc but when the symptoms show up they bail. If you ask my exes or anyone I’ve dealt with romantically 9 times out of 10 they’ll describe me as sweet/bubbly and one said I was amazing. But if that’s true why can’t they love me. I just want to be loved.

""A new study that focused on nutrition and mental health of adolescent athletes found an association between high protein consumption and a decrease in symptoms of depression.""

Therefore, there is an urgent need to reassess recommendations for protein intake in adult humans.""

I (f25) was diagnosed in mid 2021, but never categorized in 1 or 2. I was doing therapy (combo biofeedback with the intent to get to emdr) for a few months and taking 200mg lamotrigine and 10mg Lexapro, but I haven't been to therapy in months because of distance and cost, and I've been off my meds for months because the lamoteigine (I think) was causing me sleep problems. 

I work 9 hr days and 6 days a week most weeks while also helping my husband (35m) with his online business (usually don't get home most nights until 9:30). Here's where my problems start.

My husband wants sex a lot. When we first got together, we had sex every day for like a year. Then it started to slow some but was never really an issue. Now we have sex maybe once a week and it's putting a strain on our marriage. He feels like I don't love him or want him or want to be around him anymore. None of those are true and in my mind I have valid reasons for not wanting to have sex when he initiates. I have the kyleena IUD so I get some pretty painful cramps sometimes, or I'm tired, or it's late when we get home and I have to be at work a 6 am. Recently an additional pronlem is that I've become self-conscious about how I look again. He says I don't initiate enough or respond when he tries to get me in the mood. I tried to explain to him my reasons but he said I'm making it sound like a chore, and sometimes it does feel that way until I'm actually in the act and enjoying  it. It feels like too much work or too much sleep loss in exchange for little. I've gotten to the point where if we do have sex, I prefer quickies. He also says that when I initiate when he's tried, he doesn't turn me down unless he's exhausted.

Things are very strained. I feel like I'm sleeping in bed with a stranger, like an old fashioned we've never loved together or had sex before marriage type of relationship. I hate it and I hate that I can't pinpoint a cause or how to fix it. 

Is it mania? Depression? Stress? IUD? Exhaustion? Something I'm missing completely?

"I have recently moved in with my partner from across the nation. We had known each other for a long time since we were in the same community-focused nonprofit organization. We had spent a substantial time building an intimate rapport with each other and we began to fully believe we were madly in love with each other. Unfortunately when I moved in the true depth of my mental unwellness quickly forced its way to the surface. My bipolar disorder shares a dangerous comorbidity with various other mental injuries to include combat PTSD from my time in the Marine Corps, community trauma from being raised in poverty, and general childhood trauma which has resulted in an additional major depressive disorder diagnosis. 

My mood cycles rapidly as in several times in one day rapidly. The resulting agitation fills my head with various examples of why the relationship will never work despite her initial fervor to cater to my every need. Now she’s exhausted, beleaguered, and on the precipice of lapsing back into previous trauma behavior—she has PTSD from witnessing her ex-fiancée shoot himself in the head right in front of her. I have become the single most stressful thing in her life and I’ve repeatedly attempted to leave the relationship as a result but she would refuse to let me leave. 

I’m exhausted and I have a maelstrom of dark thoughts swirling through my head. Our relationship has devolved into resentment, petty squabbles, and she no longer has the energy to convince me to stay when I feel compelled to flee from the relationship even though she states she still wants me to stay even if she doesn’t have the energy to stop me from leaving. I can’t seek solace in my partner because we have become a point of contention in each others’ lives and if I keep venting to my best friend she’ll begin to grow resentful of my partner for being what she may perceive as unhealthy for me even though I share a large portion of the blame for causing our relationship to devolve to this point.  She constantly states how she needs support and cannot withstand the capricious nature of my mood swings on her own which breaks my heart to hear because now I’m fully convinced that I am far too much more trouble than I’m worth and that I am no where near at a point in my mental health recovery to be a healthy boyfriend.

"So I've been cycling since beginning of december, before it was switching back and forth around every 5 days (with about 12 hours of euthymia between the up-&gt;down switch and none in the down-&gt;up switch), but since some time in early feb it's more like switching every 21-34 hours (usually 21-24 but sometimes a cycle gets a bonus half day added to it), and this is with little or no break in between sides.


Now this is where my question comes in:  I started on latuda 20 in early feb (which seemed to work for like 3 days a week in then stop).  Then Feb 22 I got upped to 40 (as well as wellbutrin being doubled from 150-300 o_O).  Now since last week (almost exactly 2 weeks after upping the two), the pattern has started doing something extra weird....


Now, instead of just going up-down-up-down like it was before, there's a day ""break"" between the solid up and down ... and it's not euthymia it's like a funky mixed thing going on where it rapidly switches back and forth between lighter versions of both sides, with each side ranging anywhere from a couple minutes to an hour.  Then it switches into a 'full state' for a day to continue the cycle (usually it goes in order but it doesn't always).

So my question is ... I really can't understand exactly what this means ... does this mean it's getting better or worse?  I'm trying to figure out if maybe the med changes are in the right direction or if this is actually worsening ... in some ways I'd say better (since the number of 'full' cycles is technically slowed a little) but for more obvious reasons it may be worse.  Also, these bouncy days are pretty obnoxious when it comes to doing things like work because I can't actually maintain a flow since it keeps changing on me.


Has anyone had any sorta situation like this before?  Do you think this is a path toward better, or is it actually getting worse?  I would think a question like that would be obvious but ... it isn't for this o_O",questions about ultra rapid cycling/switching/mixed states,2
"I’m posting here because I’m technically diagnosed as bipolar and I suspect it could potentially be related in the form of overthinking.

Overall I’ve had pretty stable mental health since I graduated college and started working. College was hell and now I occasionally get hypomanic but nothing extreme. Even less frequently do I ever feel depressed. All without meds (has bad side effects, didn’t really help, felt like it kept me in a “sick” mindset but I digress). So I think I’m doing great overall. I feel privileged in that way.

But something I still struggle with is this feeling of existential dread I get when I mistake a mistake, am wrong, or am just being trolled.

I have many examples, but one today was someone on an academic subreddit telling me I’m wrong about something and implied I’m an idiot that doesn’t know what I’m talking about. All when this person couldn’t refute what I was saying and was generally being a d*ck focused on me being wrong instead of trying to discuss as a community.

Others have been related to feeling secluded in my field of work because I research a type of illness our product exacerbates to find preventative measures. So sometimes I have to trigger people and if I try to find colleagues to talk to “it could harm the business” which my boss is annoyed about (not violating any NDAs)

But I digress.

Basically, anytime I get shut down by someone one way or another, I have thoughts of just not wanting to continue on. Just being unable to cope with other people. 

I don’t perceive them as being s*icidal, like I wouldn’t act on it or plan or anything.

"I’ll preface this post with the fact that I have bipolar and I’m young. I know both those things contribute to the impulse of money spending. I am still in college and my parents give me money for necessities (groceries, therapy, gas money to visit home). I DID have a regular job, but I quit because of how toxic the workplace was. I babysit pretty regularly and I am in the running for a job as a ghost tour guide, so it’s not like I CAN’T afford frivolous things, but I do feel bad about not having basically any money in my savings ($20 to my name right now! It’s insane)

I am no longer someone who buys clothes just because I like them, but I did go up a few sizes due to medication increase and diet change so I’ve been having to replace a lot of my old clothes. I always shop at goodwill though and lately I haven’t had to buy that much. I don’t buy house decor anymore since I am definitely fulfilled in that aspect. I only buy art supplies when my current ones are totally out of use.

I think I impulse buy fast food or even restaurant food super easily when I can just cook it or use my meal plan at school. I only have to pay $1k-2k per year at school due to scholarships and financial aid, but it’s still a big chunk (my parents now pay half ever since I quit my job). My biggest vice, however, is legos. I buy so many legos, especially when I’m feeling anxious. They’re a super efficient distraction and a really engaging hobby. Even my parents support it because they see how it calms me and makes me happy. But my issue is that whenever I get any sort of significant money I immediately go to buy legos. I don’t know how to stop or budget or anything or put any of it into a savings account without just taking it right back out. It’s like every other week at this point.

Then it gets worse and I’ll start to get angry easily, hit stuff, yell at people over the smallest things, get drunk or high with anything close by. I’ll do illegal shit, steal stuff or try to harm myself either by relapsing, staying awake until passing out or straight up attempting suicide because why not.

"I have been thinking a lot about this today and I just want to share some thoughts with you guys. It has been 18 years since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. That I live with this is no surprise to anybody who knows me. This disease is so much more nuanced than the typical ""extreme ups and downs"" description it usually receives. I have survived two absolutely devastating depressions, and approximately twenty manic episodes. 
Attempting to describe what mania is like is the worst frustration. It happens gradually and then comes upon me like a brick to the face. First I stop sleeping, then the creativity comes. The blank page beckons to me the way freshly baked bread might entice the starving. It is soft at first, subtle even, but the persistent pen-to-page prevails and soon I am unable to make sense of, or even put into context, the hasty and paranoid puzzle of words. Grandiosity accompanies the writing, then the delusions come, and I believe that this puzzle of words is worthy of a Pulitzer. Other things happen too; reckless driving, substance use, rage, impulsivity, irrationality.... Ultimately I surrender to complete psychosis. Saying it is ""a lot"" is an understatement. 
I have destroyed and lost relationships with family members and friends because of this illness. I have said and done unforgivable things. But it is my deepest wish that people understand that becoming manic is not a choice, it has happened to me whilst on medication and off alike. I would never choose it. 
I'm simply reflecting on all of this today because earlier I read this: Bipolar disorder results in 9.2 years reduction in expected life span, and as many as one in five patients with bipolar disorder completes suicide. (National Institute of Mental Health).
That's the reality. It's my reality. I do not want to ever become a statistic and I want to live as full a life as possible.
Here is what I'm grateful for: I have an incredible support network. I have doctors and therapy. I have the most loving and supportive family and friends, ones who are able to look beyond my illness and recognize that I am not ""me"" in those manic moments. 
And I am grateful for the ability to empathize with all those who struggle.  We can do together what we could never do alone.",On Moods and Mania,2

this made me analyze my behaviors and realize when i was manic. 

movies and shows make mania seem fun. it makes it seem like a drug. it can be fun. it can be euphoric. but it’s usually so unbelievably painful. it’s excoriating. 

when i told my friends i was probably bipolar they didn’t really bat an eye, they saw me being reckless and doing risky things and they thought it was fun. 

mania is so much anger. it’s such a deep anger, i can’t explain it and i’ve realized that’s a symptom and not everyone feels it. it’s such a trip. all the things i thought were normal were probably symptoms. 

my friends thought mania was fun, they saw movies of people going out and doing drugs, they saw me going out and doing drugs but when i explained what it’s like they were terrified. and they should be. this isn’t fun. 

bipolar isn’t fun. mania needs to stop being romanticized. your perception of reality shifts, you’re angry, and even more angry that no one can help you. you do reckless things because you just don’t care. you’re filled with so much self hatred and if the consequence isn’t immediate death than it doesn’t matter. 

it’s not fun. i can’t explain how un fun it is. it’s so unstable, you can’t control your emotions, it’s constantly changing. 

it reminds me of Vampire Diaries. when they’re in transition their emotions are magnified. it can be fun but they’re usually a mess, hurting themselves, being destructive, drinking, hating themselves.

I wonder, is that a normal thing? Or is it a sign that something's up with my diagnosis and/or treatment? Will appreciate all of your input.",Meds keep losing effect — is that normal?,2
"Hey all,

I was recently diagnosed bipolar 1 but am sitting in the tattered remains of my life, wondering how I could have believed what I did.

I first felt symptoms of mania and intense narcissism this summer (I’m 28 yrs old). I had recently gone through a breakup with my partner of 6 years, had fallen in love with my female best friend (first queer experience) and she did not reciprocate my feelings, and my workload had become incredibly overwhelming.

I started losing weight and hair, had a stress rash on my body and was experiencing fluctuating feelings between paranoia to believing the universe was speaking to me directly.

But theres a delusion I am struggling with the most, that has left me feeling horrid and unforgivable. I believed my wonderful boss of 3 years had emotionally abused me, and was the reason I was experiencing mania and psychosis. I believed this so hard I convinced myself and my therapist/psychiatrist I had PTSD, and that my boss and workplace were all to blame. I told so many people this was what happened to me, because I truly believed it. I blocked my boss on everything and didn’t talk to her for 6 months.

This January I finally looked back at the texts that I thought “proved” I was abused, and found nothing but support and concern from a woman who never did anything but treat me with respect.

How the hell does this happen? Has anyone ever experienced anything similar? Honestly I’ve been feeling suicidal since the realization- I got fired from my job for other mistakes I made while manic, but I don’t know how to tell I everyone I talked to that what I believed for the last 6 months was a total lie.

"Hi. This post could be triggering to others with imposter syndrome, so I want to start off by saying that these are my own anxieties, my goal here is to know if anyone else has felt this way and if they've been able to circumvent it.  


I was officially diagnosed with BP2 by my psychiatrist in the fall, but had previously been diagnosed with a general mood disorder and major depressive disorder, and a suggestion of cyclothymia from a therapist. Bipolar 2 makes sense to me, it tracks with situations and periods of my life where I was feeling unnaturally confident and ""fun"" in a dangerous way, and more often, the periods where I've been unable to get out of bed or the house for weeks.   


Still, I have this weird fear of learning more about Bipolar Disorder, because there's a part of me that fears that if I read about it in-depth, I might start mirroring symptoms that I don't usually experience. Sometimes this includes even browsing or participating in this sub and r/bipolar2.

I think being medicated with varied success also plays into that, but I also think that's just a common bipolar experience: you find good meds and then you wonder if you're even bipolar. I feel that way when they work, but I keep on taking them. And then I will have breakthrough depression after years of being more stable on meds, and I wonder if it's a sign that I have something else wrong with me.

I've let go of the guilt now and im happy that I've committed to getting better for the future, but part of me feels sad with my brain feeling so quiet.

"Once in the land of Whippety-Woo,
Where the Squibberpops squibbered, and the Flobberjops flew,
A creature named Zeebie lived high in a tree,
Where it twisted and twined in a squiggly spree.

Now Zeebie was special, you see, my dear friend,
For the way he would feel seemed to twist and to bend.
Sometimes Zeebie would zip and would zoom,
Like a rocket ship blasting straight past the moon!

""I'm on top of the world!"" he'd exclaim with great cheer,
Bouncing high on the clouds, without any fear.
He'd giggle and wiggle and dance all day long,
Singing sweet Zeebie songs in a voice loud and strong.

But there were days when Zeebie felt quite the opposite,
His energy vanished, as if swallowed by a Glopit.
He'd mope and he'd grope for the light in the dark,
His once-sparkling eyes now a mere flickering spark.

The creatures of Whippety-Woo began to see,
That Zeebie's behavior was not as it should be.
They'd all gather 'round, full of worry and care,
But their words couldn't lift him from his deepest despair.

One day, as Zeebie lay down in the shade,
A wise Flippety-Flop hopped along and displayed,
A great book of wisdom, with secrets so grand,
It could help Zeebie balance and finally understand.

""You see, my dear Zeebie,"" the Flippety-Flop said,
""It seems that your feelings are not in your head.
A thing called Bipolar has made you this way,
But I'm here to help, so please don't dismay!""

The Flippety-Flop opened the book with a grin,
And as they read, Zeebie's eyes widened within.
He learned of the ups, of the downs, and the swings,
And how he could manage these challenging things.

""Take time for yourself, dear Zeebie,"" it said,
""Find comfort in quiet, and rest your sweet head.
When you're feeling quite high, try to harness your glee,
And channel your energy through art, dance, or a spree.""

""And when you're feeling quite low, in a pit of despair,
Please remember, dear Zeebie, that we'll all still be there.
Reach out to a friend or a Whippety-Woo,
For they'll help you get through, and they'll see you pull through.""

As Zeebie absorbed these new lessons so wise,
He wiped away tears that welled up in his eyes.
The Flippety-Flop smiled and patted his back,
Then hopped off into the sunset, his bag tightly packed.

With new tools in hand, Zeebie set out to try,
To find balance and peace beneath the bright sky.
He'd still have his ups, and he'd still have his downs,
But he knew that his friends in the Whippety-Woo town, Would always stand by him, through thick and through thin, No matter how high or how low he'd begin.
For Zeebie was loved, and he'd always be so,
A creature with feelings, and a heart that would grow.

So remember, dear reader, this story so true,
When life gets you down, or your feelings construe.
There's always a way to find balance and peace,
In a world full of love, where friendships won't cease.

"So for a few weeks I've been wondering if I was going on a hypomanic episode. Ive been diagnosed bp 2 a year ago and since medicated, found a combo that works for me since november 22. Before that it was either really depressed and a bit of mixed and latest major hypomanic episode in summer 2021. 

So it had been a while and the thing is, I'm still very slow and sleep a lot, but compared to before when I slept 10-12 hours a night every 24h now I still sleep 10-12h but  I stay awake 24h+ multiple times a week.

Last friday I went to my psychiatrist and he asked me if I had any hints of impulsivity that could indicate hypomania, specifically spznding, sex and substance abuse (ya know the usual menu).
And I thought about it for a moment (in retrospect I was making up excuses that would make things logical) and then said no, just spending but for necessary stuff.

And here I am exactly a week later, wearing one of my two new wigs that arrived from aliexpress yesterday (I had only bought one super cheap one before), been smoking weed since monday and unpacking my new dildo in my newly fairyland garden themed decorated kitchen. Oh also received 150 bucks worth of beauty products (I've never done skincare before in my life except sheet masks and face creams from aldi).
For clarification I bought it all before seeing my psychiatrist and smoking again.

"I just can’t get it out of my head that I’m not.

But this past January I:

-thought I was an Aztec chased by jaguars and loved the feeling of fighting for my life. It was exhilarating. 

-thought the Starbucks mermaid lady was laughing at me and that walls were moving. Also heard some voices.

-walked through puddles in the rain and got my clothes and shoes sopping wet because I thought I’d be reincarnated as a mentally healthy person

-saw cameras where there were none 

-thought people on the bus were plotting to kill me 

-thought an escalator was gonna eat me

-kept dissociating 

-pretended to eat my fingers like they were chicken tenders, looked in the mirror and thought my mouth was full with my fingers and laughed at myself, then I was horrified.

-in my head was thinking “I must grab the skin and scooped it out” and realized I was picking at my face and stopped myself 

-overall I was unstable for around 2 weeks

-was incredibly depressed for around a month afterwards 

But I was able to reality check. I was very agitated but I worked okay and hid the symptoms successfully and let myself enter the other world when I was alone. I don’t remember how sleep went but it wasn’t bad. I took myself to the hospital when I almost walked into traffic bc I was dissociating badly and terrified by the mix of suicidal/self-destructive thoughts and intense glee. But I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and then later at a php another psychiatrist confirmed the diagnosis?

And these past four days I’ve had unbearable amounts of energy. Rock climbed for hours. Disappeared in music to the point that I forgot I was listening to music and the noises scared me. Everything feels so good. It feels good on my fingers to type this. I can feel the energy of cars passing by. I can feel the patterns of tree branches. Also irritated with other people at points (they talk too slow!).  Have had trouble sleeping and feel fine. Felt connected to the universe. Felt funny in my head. I’m on lithium so I’m self aware and I don’t get as many bizarre thoughts as I did the first time around.

But I don’t get the urge to buy things. On this subreddit people say they buy things but I don’t do that. And now Im beginning to feel a bit of sleepiness and mania has to last seven days to be mania, doesn’t it? I feel like I’m faking it. I see some symptoms align with bp but I’m thinking of stopping my medication and then I’ll see if this is truly mania/hypomania. I just don’t know.

"Sometimes I feel like it's a merry go round. I've been on so many that I've lost count.

I'm sure there's others but just don't remember them. I've had side effects from the majority of them. 

Lithium destroyed my thyroid and caused me to gain weight rapidly, Risperdal made me incredibly stiff in the mornings where it was hard to get out of bed, Zoloft made me yawn for zero reason constantly, Seroquel made me aggressive and hard to wake up.

"Hi everyone,

I have been seeing the same therapist for almost two months now. While I think we are working well together, I am getting the feeling that I am repeating myself every session. 

I just can't help but overthink my whole life. This tends to obsessively question my career, constant negative self talk, and occasional suicidal ideation (although I could never take action, so its mostly more self torture).  I'm eating maybe 1 to 2 meals a day, inconsistently showering, never doing laundry, and so lethargic that I mostly just lay down and watch tv/YouTube whenever I get home from work. I don't take walks, I don't try to think positively, I don't really exercise, I don't practice gratefulness, etc etc. I feel like a loser, but the thing is...I don't make any effort to change or feel better.

My therapist keeps clearly telling me this rumination is simply not beneficial. I know this is true, but it feels impossible to stop. I can't feel better without taking action (again, total agreement with my therapist), but taking action is so hard. Its getting to the point where I am thinking I am comfy in my misery. I no longer have hypomanic phases thanks to medication, but at least when I was hypomanic I was putting in effort to better myself. This nonstop depression is so consistent, I am beginning to hypothesize that its not really depression, but me continuously self sabotaging myself and always blaming it on something external.

Can anyone relate? Would you say this is just more negative rumination or overthinking? If not, how does one shake the refusal to take action for their own sake?",I Am Worried I Actually Don't Want to Get Better,2
"38m.  February 2022, I finalized my divorce.  I had been trapped in a dysfunctional marriage for 7 years.  During those years, I was incredibly stable, but incredibly over medicated.  Towards the end when things were at their worst, I was alone self medicating with alcohol.  During those years, I was on Venlafaxine, Seroquel, and Lamotragine.

In February, with a fresh start to life, I started exercising and eating better.   I stayed away from my phone and computer, and I would go out and socialize.  I started looking better and feeling better.  Knowing the side effects of the meds, I started tweaking the dosages.  Seroquel in particular is incredibly sedating, so I thought I could go down a natural route, managing my bipolar with healthy stress management.  I saw improvements.  I had more energy, my rest was better.  I kept lowering the dosages and kept seeing improvements with my mood and energy.  I was aware of the risk of mania, so I was very acute in getting enough sleep, and if I needed to, I would use seroquel more as a PRN.

Fast forward to June, and this slope lead me to a path where I was completely off all medication.  I was making strides in all areas of my life.  In particular, my relationship with my daughter.  We were having a blast and an incredible start to the  summer with my motivation and optimism for life.  All while this was happening, I was keeping watch on my mania, never denying that it could pop up at some point.

It would be about when July hit that the first occurrences of mania became apparent in retrospect but wasn't obvious or out of control at the time.  It was the beginnings of losing touch with reality.  Passing interactions with other people, I would sometimes get a hint that I had a larger purpose.  But they were fleeting and rare, so I didn't take notice.

By the end of July, I was semi-regularly battling against these thoughts that the strangers I would come across would be part of a conspiracy, and that there was some purpose behind their being there.  I was in conflict with myself.  90% of me didn't believe it, and thought it was ridiculous, 9% thought that it was my duty to be humble with getting recognition and attention, and 1% was feeding into the delusion.

By the end of August, I was getting exhausted with the notion of being at the center of everything.  I hated the idea that I had to be studied, admired, and protected.  I ""knew"" that something was happening on the outside world, and I didn't know if I was seen as a reconciler of religion, science, and all cultures.  I was seen as the person to bring the whole world together and the inspiration of a movement that could potentially solve any problem.  It was seen as the opportunity for aliens to finally make their presence known.

By the end of September, I knew there were reasons that ""the movement"" couldn't directly come to light to me, and I being in a sort of partnership with the movement, I started giving my personal belongings away.  I would donate my clothes, my coin collection, my golf clubs, my old baseball glove, and most of my other stuff.  It was my belief that each item would go to a person in need, and every item would be cherished by someone.  I sort of expected to get something in return, but never did of course.  Or if I did, I stole it thinking I was meant to steal it.  I was also writing and doing art at this point, which I was also leaving behind on purpose in public places.

When October rolled around, I quit my job because when the world was following me, I saw my job as a way for me to feel normal for a while.  I didn't want to give up my old life, but I had a higher calling.  It would have been around October 24th when I was completely exhausted from all of this.  I couldn't handle the pressure.  I couldn't handle the fact that most of me still didn't believe this shit, but that brainwashing-propaganda-part-of-the-brain that kept feeding me these thoughts, I was exhausted fighting that all those months.

I had the idea to go find some weed.  I never smoked it before in my life.  So, I went to a vape store and asked if they had anything that could get me high.  They gave me a canister and a battery.  I didn't look at it or do any research because with everything being planted and all information to my phone being filtered, there was no point.  I went home, and smoked it.  I went into a panic immediately.  Thinking I was going to die, I called an ambulance.  They came but they didn't seem too concerned when they got here.  I was getting frustrated because they weren't taking this ""emergency"" seriously.

I was out of my mind psychotic.  I fell to the floor ""devolving"" from a human to a werewolf, to smaller and smaller mammals up to and including being a microorganism.  I remember ""going offline"" and coming back online a few times.  I remember seeing a coordinate graph where the line kept splicing off the edge, and it felt like I kept dying.   It felt like I was shedding timelines where I actually died there, but I kept surviving in this one.  I remember being in the bed in the ambulance with the EMT, and he would turn from male to female, and I wrestled with the idea of ""male"" and ""female"" at the most abstract level (almost like properties of the universe).  I remember re-living my life organized in different ways, and coming back to the EMT each time, thinking that this is the infinite cycle of existence.  I have only small fragments after that, but apparently I had a ""freak out"" moment in the hospital, and they saw it as me being aggressive to one of the personnel.  I was arrested, handcuffed, and brought to jail, charged with a felony, simple assault on emergency personnel.

In jail, my parents were not willing to bail me out without being on meds.  The jail system here is completely dysfunctional, and there's basically no mental health support, so there was no way for me to get on my meds.  After about 3 days living in an open dorm situation, the other inmates took notice of my behavior and obvious mental health issues.  They're bored and destructive people, so they preyed on my mental weakness, and I stayed strong as best I could.  I can't go into every thought I had, but there was a night that I thought my family was kidnapped and were being tortured and murdered one by one.  The inmates were feeding the thoughts, and when it got to my daughter, I couldn't hear anymore.  I went into the bathroom, got as high as I could (about 8 feet), jumped, and pushed off the ceiling trying to land my head on the concrete.  I didn't lean back far enough and landed on my spine.  The pain was intense and I threw up the shampoo, soap, and cleaner that I drank about an hour earlier.  I shit my pants and was writhing in pain.  The officers rushed in to check things out.  I pleaded for them to shoot me telling them it will save my daughter.  I kept begging them to do it.  They told me to get up.  Walking to suicide isolation, I felt reassured that what I did put an end to them murdering my family.  I was in suicide watch for 20 days, which, if someone weren't suicidal, would make someone.  I had no clothes but a velcro towel, and I had to shit in a hole and smash the turd down with my foot so it would go through the bars.  I couldn't have more than a few squares of toilet paper.  Nothing to read.  My bed was the concrete.  I'm not complaining because it is what it is.  It's jail and I was there.  But what was the worst part is the back pain lying on the concrete.  No position felt good, it was simply finding the least painful position and last as long as I could before that became too much, and just keep shuffling to find something that's tolerable for just a moment.

After 28 days, there were enough people who got involved that I was finally able to get released on bail with a treatment order.  I got back on my meds, and I've been on them since.  I've slipped into a real bad depression.  The charges were dropped 10 days ago.  I'm resuming my job search (it's impossible to find a job with 'assault' on your record).  The arrest itself can still be found if an employer does a certain background check, but nothing I can do about that.  I slipped into drinking semi-regularly, but I've pulled out of that the last 2 weeks.  All in all, I'm holding on by a thread, but there is hope.

Oh, I forgot that the night of the incident.  I had all my money, $20k dollars in cash, stolen from my apartment.  I have no proof, but my intuition tells me that one of the officers took it when they were searching my apartment.",Manic for 6 months ending up in jail where I had a suicide attempt.,2

I just want to come to terms with it. I don't know what my abilities are, how smart I am anymore. I'm certainly not capable of any kind of degree or a job anymore. I can't learn a trade or skill. I couldn't be an electrician or an engineer or a programmer or a writer.

All I want, more than anything, is a purpose. I would take a job even if I wasn't paid. I can't volunteer though. I'm simply not smart enough anymore. I'm dumber than a rock now.

At this point I’m just bracing for impact and waiting to see if it’s hypomania or not. I say hypomania/mania because I experience both and my therapist still can’t decide if it’s bipolar I or II.

"Hi, doctors haven't told me yet a diagnosis, because maybe this is temporary, but they told me it could be bipolar. I don't believe in mental illness, they are all symptoms of trauma and discrimination, or whatever intoxication of delusional feelings that other brought into our minds, we got fed up with them and developed an unhealthy mind and behaviour because we got stuck in them. 

I think the wish to have power or isolating ourselves from others, to be distinguished is something I noticed about me. On the other hand, we can't deny we are more sensible and perceptive. 

But it is key to allways search for balance. But we can question this, also, because why can't we have a society in which we encounter many surprises? Maybe it would be chaotic.","Hi, what's up",2

"So, let me use an example bc I do not know what to do with myself right now, I've been having a very bad depressive episode this week and today I needed the help of someone very close to me who also happens to be my coworker. I messed up, life has been extra overwhelming lately and it's hard to work, I can't focus and even the smallest of things drain me even if those around me don't see it, it's so hard to do daily tasks im so tired of it all. 
I messed up, and there was an order I did not place by mistake, I forgot about it, and I even forgot what I had spoken to this particular client about. I was sure he remembered who I was, and i was terrified of looking like a dumbass and him asking for a supervisor bc this is the kind of person he is. So I asked my friend to help me, I was frantic, and I am one to always help anyway I can when there's a mistake on their part or anything goes down, no matter how busy I am with my own things. They did not seem thrilled that I asked for help and  didn't even get a confirmation on whether or not they'd help. Perhaps I'm making this bigger than it is, but it was hurtful to see how unwilling they were to help me while I was panicking. I rarely ask anything of anybody bc I have learned to be self-sufficient, and bc with bipolar I have 0 friends. I'm just sad that I didn't get a smidgen of consideration and just went for it on my own. Issue is being resolved now, and after 20 minutes, my coworker has approached me to say, ""So what do I have to do?"" Meaning when I explained everything earlier, including the solution, they were not even paying attention. I told them I got it now, and they walked away annoyed.

I've heard everyone talk about increased appetite but since I've started taking it 3 times a day I've just been eating a small breakfast and a small dinner because I'm just not hungry...

I started taking a mood stabilizer and an antipsychotic after being diagnosed with bipolar type II earlier last year. It took a lot to admit there was an issue and to seek a psychiatrist. I was proud of the progress I made this last year. I felt great until a coworker made me feel like shit and that my progress meant nothing

I have a coworker that is much older than me, he frequently talks down to me in front of the entire team and has the attitude that his opinion is gospel no matter the circumstances. I’m two years out of college with limited experience so I approached him about my frustration and how I can improve. He got very defensive and denied any part in this. Instead of talking it through with me he monologued about mental health and seeking a therapist to talk about my frustrations at work instead

I sat there and listened to him monologue trying to act like it was fine, but damn did it hurt to be talked down to about my mental health.

So I would never tell anyone at work that and broadly speaking these people are supposed to be empathetic and nice healthcare workers. So I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what people actually think of us when they don’t have to be politically correct about it cuz they know they aren’t speaking to people who will be directly hurt or offended by what they have to say.

i’ve been a “stoner” for years, but have tapered off after receiving my diagnosis and learning it was counterproductive. however, it’s still a way i unwind or work up an appetite and i’ll definitely miss the calming aspects of the ritual. with alcohol, i definitely increased my consumption with onset of symptoms, and never get to a sloppy blackout level, but i drink with dinner at a low amount whenever appropriate. i’ve also been taking ritalin for a long time as i was previously diagnosed adhd (although that’s being reevaluated now since bipolar is often first misdiagnosed as adhd), and she’s requested i drop that too because stimulants can worsen symptoms. 

i know it’s best to stop and see where it gets me. the fact that i’m irritated about stopping proves to me that it’s a good idea. in the past i’ve had issues with extreme boredom during sobriety, and i’m also worried about stopping since it has become sort of a band aid for the pain. i am worried that when i get manic, sad, or bored my resolve to stay sober will crumble. i would really appreciate tips or mantras. maybe something to replace the sort of feeling from any of those? anything is appreciated.",tips on strengthening resolve about sobriety?,2

I don’t feel any better though. Well of course not, nothing has actually changed. I have been taking Lamictal but not feeling any positive effects yet. 

I had been told for years it’s depression, anxiety and one doctor said it sounded hormonal. I thought that I would get better. I thought that I would recover and live a healthy, normal life. I feel like I have to mourn the idea of this now. 

I’m not getting much help behind this diagnosis. They say because I’ve never been hospitalised and I manage to hold down a job and maintain relationships I don’t need it. I get it but it hurts. I feel invalidated, confused and alone.

I managed to get myself a good job at a company I could have only dreamed of working for. I am fucking it up though. I do nothing most days. I’m so consumed by what’s going on in my head whether it’s good or bad. 

I’m going to have to go back to a less demanding job which breaks my heart and I feel if leave it will trigger an episode. I’m scared I’ll impulsively quit one day too like my last 4 jobs. Maybe I’ll get fired first anyway.

How can I bring this up with them without it being possible I end up sectioned?,If I tell my therapist in an online session that I have a plan and am thinking of acting on it this weekend will they send ems or the police to my house?,2
"Hi, first post to this Sub. 

(If anything I say is not allowed please let me know in a message even if you do remove the post so I can be more mindful in the future)

Kinda nervous moving forward but today I finally went to a Psych and after about an hour of talking about different thing's she settled upon one sure for diagnoses of BP2 and immediately prescribed Latuda 20mg at night during dinner. I had spoken with a therapist years ago and was on Trintellix and also tried Zoloft which did nothing but give me headaches and the other made me rage out (respectively). I found out many of the things I do in my daily life are actually Symptoms of both Mania and Depression and that I'm going through episodes of both Multiple times a day for the past 4 years that we covered.

I also have Chrons disease and I saw how it can affect weight and appetite, so I'm hopeful it can boost that as well as get my Racing thoughts, Insomnia and Hyper Productivity to a normal/manageable level. Im very leery about taking it with the experiences I've had with antipsychotics in the past, but my Dr also works with my wife who is ADHD and BP2, and I've seen how our Dr has helped her by listening to her and not just her diagnosis.

I'm on a Month trial at the 20mg so hopefully no severe side effects or medication interactions and this does what it needs to. And I apologize ahead of time to those on this Sub, I will most likely be spam reading a lot of your posts in the coming days just to understand different perspectives of this, cause I won't say I love it but I have a special thing about researching all I can about new things, especially medical. 

Thank you all in advance",Just Diagnosed today,2
"First time poster on this sub, but I feel like I need support. Sorry for the format, I am on mobile. 

I feel like my psychiatrist at my most recent appointment was talking to me in a way that made it feel like I was being stupid or taking myself too seriously on what my problems could be. 

I'm diagnosed with a mood disorder and my previous psychiatrist strongly suspected I may be bipolar due to the symptoms I experience. I've been open and shared a lot of my issues with my psychiatrist, but he doesn't seem to care.

What really grinded my gears though was him saying ""well I'm not sure if you really are bipolar because you don't show one of the most common symptoms which is the lack of need for sleep. And I don't mean only needing 5 or 6, I mean more like 2."" To which I had to tell him that no, I have had that back in high school most prominently. I never was diagnosed with bipolar and didn't know what it was before I started my mental health journey, so at the time I didn't think much of having little to no sleep when younger and figured it was normal to go a day or two without sleeping. 

To which he asks me ""well how did that change over the course of time?"" It's called forcing myself to get tired by mentally or physically exerting a lot and also becoming a single parent helps with getting tired a lot faster.

 I felt horrible and hurt because it felt like I had to justify to myself that I'm not crazy, that it's not normal to struggle going to bed before midnight, that feeling crazy swings back and forth isn't normal. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and I feel like expressing to him how the psych treated me made me feel like I'm being stupid or blowing things out of proportion. I hate this and I hate feeling out of control of my own emotions most of the time, and I just want to be taken seriously. I see now why so many women struggle to get diagnosed; ""it's all in your head"" or ""that's just normal for a woman to be moody"" 

Have any of you ever had this happen on your journeys to getting help with your diagnosis/treatments? I want to know I'm not alone...",Psychiatrist belittling me,2
"Hello!

 I just started seeing therapist privately, and she said what I say it's definitely similar to bipolar disorder. She has seen me once.

 I've seen 4 more therapist in the past, in the public system. Except for one which was really good but I was in an ""up"" moment, the other just said that I was fine and dumped me.

I'm scared, but also happy that finally someone understands what I feel and that my struggles are validated, and I'm not making it up or just being lazy and a bit weird sometimes.

I just wanted to share, as except for my boyfriend and a friend, I don't want to tell anyone right now.

Thank you ♥️",Love my new therapist,2
"Hey everyone, I (18M) have had a mental illness all my life. That being ADHD. I was on Medication for it for about eight years, until last year, when I began to feel... different.

My ADHD used to consist of hyperfixation, hyperactivity and inability to concentrate- so normal ADHD stuff, but last year before I graduated high school in May, I noticed something was changing. I assumed it was my ADHD, just evolving with new symptoms as I got older but towards Graduation time and shortly thereafter, I realized I was wrong. 

It began to get worse with huge depressive episodes, I would cry, or feeling like crying some days, and be fine the next. And I would feel worthless, like I didn't mean or contribute anything, and then have confidence that soared through the roof. I started snapping on people and then being okay the next second. 

The anger and mood swings problems got worse within the past few months. I work retail, and I've been showing attitude and anger and even hatred one moment, and then I'm super happy and energetic the next second. Even outside of work, I snap at my parents, my best friend and have constant negative emotions. I have started talking super-super fast without realizing, and feel like my thoughts are going a million miles an hour. (MY Psych mentioned this to me yesterday). 

One of the biggest things that coincides with the anger and mood swings is my impulse control and motivation. One thing I lack is impulse control, I know something is wrong, but I still choose to do it anyway. This has affected me with porn, gaming too much, and most importantly- spending. I have credit cards and I paid them off a month ago, and once again I have a huge balance on both, because I know I shouldnt be spending money, but in the moment it feels like I should. Also the lack of motivation issue is *huge*. I want to go to the gym, I want to go out and do things, but I just *can't* no matter how hard I force myself to try.

After an argument with my mom about how she's worried about me and how she knows something is wrong, I came clean and told her that I've been keeping how I've been feeling from her, my dad, sisters, and my psychiatrist and therapist. I was afraid to be on new medicine and to be diagnosed with something new. My psych told me that sometimes ADHD can evolve or even be mistaken for Bipolar, since the two share similar symptoms. I was put on Latuda yesterday, and I feel no difference yet, since it takes 3 weeks or more to do so, but I'm hopeful. And hopefully I can learn to live with this since it's a part of me now.",I was diagnosed with Bipolar II yesterday. I guess it's my life now.,2
"I feel so isolated and afraid. Things are turning, crumbling. I feel like I can't turn to anyone. My psychologist and doctor understand but damn the nights are so long, and in the day, I have to be around so many people I can't tell what's going on for me. Some professionals even don't understand me unless they know me very well. I'm a serial masker and even when I'm wanting to throw a chair through a window I'll just casually say ""I'm raging right now"" and they don't take notice lol. So some professionals don't take notice and others say things like ""I'm very alarmed"" at my behaviour. I just can't be that person I used to be anymore; exploding rage and emotion. Luckily a have professionals that see the signs clearly but talking to others can make me feel invisible.

I feel like everyone in society, the world around me, online, is watching everything I'm saying and doing, even people in cars or shop assistants. Which I know sounds ridiculous, but I feel like I can't move a muscle or say a thing, it's constant. It's even hard to post here.

It was fun with the spiritual and sensual bliss but now it's just hell. I made the mistake of having a nap before midnight and I won't sleep tonight. I got an exam today, I'll see my nurse thankfully, then my therapist, but right now I just see this long stretch of night ahead of me. The house is so quiet, I'm worried I'll see ghosts if I leave my room lol. I just feel so very alone.

College helped so much, they're very supportive there, my classmates are amazing but it's getting confusing for me there, too. My mouth is starting to get me in trouble. I feel like my world is getting smaller section by section. 

My psychologist said it was ok for me to go to a Buddhist centre for a few days as long as I don't drive there, as long as I stick to grounding meditation rather than the transendental stuff lol. So maybe that will help me a lot.

I don't even know what this post is about. It's just all crumbling down, now. I might try to switch channels in my brain rather than hyperfocusing on my phone. Have something to eat and drink. Maybe try sleep again.

I'm focusing so inwardly; thoughts, feelings, etc. I need to get out of my head and into my body. I try to do the mindfulness 5 things but I'm too paranoid about ghosts right now. I wanna listen to my headphones but can't for the same reason. I think I'm literally too afraid to leave my bed or do anything but type, and too paranoid to ring a hotline. I'm dreading 3 am but hopefully I will be asleep by then.

I dunno, maybe this post is an ask for someone out there to make me feel like I'm not one alien on an Earth full of humans lol. Either way I just gotta get it off my chest.",The paranoia is killing me,2
"I recently did intake with a 'medication management clinic' because I wanted to renew the prescriptions my now-retired psychiatrist gave me, but they informed me that two of the meds, Ambien and Ativan, they don't prescribe at all, and Wellbutrin is not something they would let me take without an antipsychotic. Because I already have some samples from my old doctor I've been told to start Vraylar. After looking it up I am very hesitant to take it. I have a number of other medical and emotional issues having to do with weight gain and suicidal thoughts among other things, and what I read has me worried. I just wanted a little help me out of the downturn rut I'm in and ease my anxiety and hypervigilance. I have my swings but haven't been hospitalized in 8 years, basically since I stopped taking mood stabilizers (I tried a bunch of different ones in the last 15 years). This a clinic, not a personal relationship like with all the p-docs before, and I don't think the lengthy computerized questionnaire is set up to flag the nuances of my requirements, like weight neutral or not mind numbing. I just want to comfortably exist in the world, able to think clearly enough to get things done and without the paranoia edge that I live with now, but if muscle jerks, increased hospitalizations and diabetes are the price I have to pay maybe life as a hermetic loner is something I have to just accept.",back on the med-go-round maybe?,2

"I was recently diagnosed with bipolar depression. After reading more and more of the posts on this reddit, I've finally felt like I've found the people I've been looking for. I cannot even find the words to express how isolating it is trying to describe some of the symptoms to people. They try their best to relate, but no one ever gets it. The struggles with time distortion between hypomania and depression. The cleaning and reorganizing because you feel like I'm doing so, you have reinvented yourself. The countless abandoned hobbies picked up during a manic episode, where you feel like you posess the ability to learn everything at a superhuman rate. The changes in how much sleep you need. Feeling like a different person, snapping at people and regretting half of the decisions you've made. The suicidal thoughts. It's all so overwhelming, but seeing that others are dealing with the same type of life and coping with it actually brought me to tears tonight. Thank y'all, for sharing your experiences.

I couldn’t even tell if that makes you feel better 

No, it doesn’t. It doesn’t make me feel better. It makes me feel like you think bipolar is a sticky note that says CRAZY on my forehead, and not a mental illness I wrangle and defeat on a daily basis.

Hi I’m new to Reddit and have been using  Facebook and tiktok as my resources besides reading articles about bipolar disorder. I was diagnosed 6-7 years ago with bipolar 1 and I’m still trying to figure it out. Been off and on with my meds. (Currently off with approval of psychiatrist) I’ve been trying to figure this out still. It’s hard but I’m still trying to figure out my mania. Right now I feel like I’m making risky choices. Like playing with fire with my marriage and sex life. Is infidelity part of mania. I know I’ve heard and read many different things on mania and I know some people on the pages have struggled and this is why their marriages fail and I feel I’m at risk with mine but I miss this risk part which is why I think I want to play with fire?

"so i know this wasn’t a good idea, but after about 8 months of taking my medication regularly (lexapro, lamictal, and abilify) i stopped taking them cold turkey. i stopped seeing my psychiatrist because it felt like a chore but i do see my therapist regularly. for a while after stopping my medication i started drinking every single night to get rid of the uneasiness i felt and just to help me sleep. drinking really became a nasty habit for me. one night after work i took it too far, i’ve had problems with a. toxic relationship for a while and while at work he ended up blocking me out of spite and i didn’t care much because i knew i would just go home and a have a drink. but , that night i came home and got so drunk i started getting super paranoid that someone was watching me and i was crying and i guess talking on the phone so loudly my mother came to check on me. (i’m 19 and still live with my parents) but i was upset because she started questioning if i was drunk and said to hang up the phone but i told her i was finally happy and i don’t remember much from that night but apparently the next day my mom told me tht i got violent with her and threatened to “beat the fuck out of her” if she didn’t leave me alone. anyways, because of that night i haven’t had any access to alcohol, and i’m proud of myself for sticking to that because i would even drink at my boyfriends house and he could get me drinks if i wanted but i’ve been good with it and the only substance i put in my body is nicotine now. 

but now that i’ve been good with that stuff, i’ve become angry, and i pick fights with whoever’s around me, i get violent and suicidal thoughts and im at a point where i feel worthless. i don’t think my environment is helping me. i dropped out of college and i know my parents are disappointed in me. because of my mental health it’s been hard for me to get a job, and now i have a part time in the mall and it’s a really good environment and very distracting. however my dad is on my case about how it’s not a real job and i’m pretty much useless in the house and i don’t contribute to anything. i want to respect him and do more, but it’s hard to be in a house where everyone is depressed and projects their issues. my mother is also bipolar but is always giving me advice she can’t take. i know it’s not easy having a kid who’s bipolar, but it seems like they don’t even try to understand me. everyday i wake up and feel so stuck. i feel like i don’t have a place here. even my hardest isn’t enough.

"Hi guys , 

So I am a bipolar and I haven't actually told anyone but few about my bipolarity. Anyway I believe being a bipolar affects the way I am thinking and the decisions I make according to my emotions which are instable and which will eventually lead to a feeling of regret and guilt later.

So my problem is that now while the usual and frequent depressive episodes trigger, this depressive episode is the WORST so far, I live in this paradoxical loop and cycle between my past and all these nostalgic moments I am always recalling in my mind that could make me sometimes happy but also crying because I miss these moments so much and miss the people that I don't see anymore but have been a great part in my life nevertheless left me for either no reason or with a reason that I couldn't really do anything about it, my present which is affected negatively by my nostalgia and emotions for the past and taking a great amount of time just living in the memories, living in the past and dreams instead of living in the present time, and my future which l do think about but don't care about it anymore, sometimes I used to think about my future to forget about the past but failed to do so. 

Thinking about what I could do in the future makes me a bit happy nevertheless when these nostalgic moments hit me, it just converts me from a happy person to a sad, desperate and disappointed person again that eventually lead to deep depression which cause suicidal ideation, mostly to overdose to death, but ends up with failed attempts to commit suicide. I can't even determine if these memories are good or bad by now cuz it depends as well, sometimes I just get the good parts of the memories while other times I just get the tragic parts and events that happened to me as for getting bullied recently at the university, losing my best friend, losing my boyfriend ...etc. I just believe by now that good memories are even worse and more hurtful than the bad ones. It just feels like getting stabbed in the back.

These many emotions and mixed-up thoughts I get give me a headache and usually panic attacks, that sometimes I cut myself with a nearby sharp thing as well.

I also have ADHD, social phobia and severe trust issues. I now feel so bad that I wish this world to stop and my life ends.

- Losing sleep, (but not quite all of it—I have an anxiety med that increases need for sleep though so that could play a role)
- Paranoia about all my friends and the world around me
- Risky decisions in terms of conversations with friends, putting myself in a physically dangerous position, and the things I put inside my body
- Hearing whispers
- Feeling like God (and being pretty good at convincing myself I am)
- Sensory issues specifically with touch
- Making boatloads of artwork (it’s my hobby)
- Over-emoting
- S*lf h*rm, but not taking time out of my day to do it, just doing a project or task and being like “I bet I can h*rt myself doing this”
- Talking a lot and having something to say about everything
- Doing tasks super rushed and poorly
- The urge for violence (verbal or physical)
- Not responding to people because I’m in a thrill of art or work
- Leaving my house at any hours during the night/day
- Etc. I’ll edit if I think of anymore",What does a manic/hypomanic episode look like for you?,2

"Edit: Should have put MIXED in title. During mania - we need sex to straighten out sometimes. 

I’m on the end swing out of a mixed which has lasted about ten days. I wasn’t in psychosis or anything extreme. I’m not off my meds so it wasn’t super dramatic or anything. Worst thing I did was throw a cheeseburger into the sink when I got some bad news about my dog. 

So, we had sex last night and afterwards when we were cuddling in bed he kissed me and said “I’m so glad you’re back. I missed you.” 

We chatted a bit more and he said he’s been dodging my sexual advances because I wasn’t feeling like myself and he felt wrong about pursuing anything sexual when I wasn’t my exact self.

"I've been hypomanic for the last 3 weeks. I'm medicated and I'm teetotal etc so it was relatively minor. But fuck me does the depression hit me like a ton of bricks.

Then in a few days I'll feel all the mental affects coming in. If I'm lucky I'll just be comatose for a month. But if a mixed state comes along then it's panic attacks, anxiety, despair and suicidal ideation. Fingers crossed it's just depression.

The hypomania was alright this time around. I have spent a bit too much, worked a bit too hard, overshared a bit too much, socialised a bit too much. But no real damage this time. It was intense but kind of pleasant. But I can feel the dip is going to be huge. This is anecdotal but it feels like if my mania is under control (no psychosis and no mixed state) the depression part is deeper. Feel kind of quietly melancholic on an epic scale.

"Hello all , I’m new here but I feel like I shouldn’t be lol 
Yesterday was kind of a mental health day as I was talking to a social worker who was helping me find a new therapist. Long story short we got into my previous diagnosis’ and I told her mild depression , adhd and anxiety. Yes these are true but however the one that is relevant to this post that popped up that I didn’t know was bipolar. I end up contacting my previous psychiatrist because I did not recall him saying this ( I swear he didn’t ) and he said yes but it is unspecified. He diagnosed me because of my constant irritability and made a point to say today I may be in remission because I wasn’t as snappy as before. I honestly Just thought the things he would say would rub me the wrong way. Next week he’ll do a full evaluation. 

A few years back another therapist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder I forgot which , but I remember her say something of me being manic. I honestly don’t think she’s working anymore but I wanted this evaluation at the time because I believed I was bipolar starting around 13-16 years old. I had my reasons for it. Fast forward to last year my last psychologist said I was misdiagnosed and it was just adhd/add. I had mentioned my sex drive/hyper sexuality (which I may speak on in another post), my impulsive urges to do things, mood swings that can be intense, etc etc she said it was just a mixture of my depression and adhd. 
So now here I am, and thinking back to the things I’ve done before and do now. These things I am trying to control and make sense of mainly the hyper sexuality I started to wonder if I was just a sex addict because of my habits and started looking into help to stop these things but yet my only problem is when I’m in the mood lol. 
I’m at a point in life where I want a second opinion, or I just don’t want to believe or say I am even though I have the signs more than I’ve even mentioned.","Rant but not really,newly diagnosed but then again I’m not",2

"Long story short, I was diagnosed with depression back in 2021 after a rough year and 2 failed suicide attempts December 2021. Physically and mentally I made a full recovery by May 2022, my ex of 7 years cheated on me in June and I surprisingly dealt with it really well. I’d been off work March-September due to factors outside my control which was stressful but again, I dealt with it well. I returned to work and on one of my first days back the most beautiful woman I had ever seen walked into the office. I’m a confident bloke but I was nervous AF! I spoke to her for a bit and thought there would be no way she would like me, fast forward a few hours later and she’d requested to follow me on instagram and we got chatting. We met shortly after for a date and it was like we’d know each other years, best date ever. From this point we both took it slow and just let things happen naturally. The connection we had was unlike any other and for both of us to feel the same was just unreal. I asked her to be my girlfriend in October and she was genuinely excited about it, this made me realise I’d found someone special. Shortly after this I had a serious family emergency and that was ongoing till January, she was my rock, my guardian angel throughout this whole ordeal. I’m 29 and I’ve cared for people a lot in relationships but never been in love despite them all being long term. I thought I was incapable but this woman changed that and she’s the first I’ve ever loved, and hopefully the last. On 02/01/23 the family emergency situation came to a close with expected but still devastated news. From this day on my mental health started to deteriorate but predictably, nothing too rapid. 05/01/23 I went over to my Nan’s house late at night after work to drop a birthday card off for her birthday the following day. I walked in to find her dead on the kitchen floor, this was the day I deteriorated rapidly. I needed my girlfriend desperately for support but I was just far too much to deal with. I wasn’t just depressed, this time it was different. I was awake 4-8 days regularly and would only sleep when I’d black out. I was exhausted but completely and utterly hyper fixated on anything that came into my head. Because it was my girlfriend who had become distant I stupidly bombarded her with messages begging for help and reminding her how much I love her. She wasn’t leaving me she just needed space and I could cope on my own. 20/02/23 2 men tried to steal my car and I managed to keep the car and defend myself but suffered some bad injuries in the process. I was hit 11 times with a knuckle duster and 40+ times by the other bloke with just his fists. I was left with 4 skull fractures, fractured orbital bone, broken nose and broke jaw. I’m an ex professional Muay Thai fighter so I’m used to a certain level of pain and discomfort but this was different, although I now have slurred speech, blind in my right eye and have lost substantial weight this hurt me mentally. I started to have panic attacks and I was going through episodes of what can only be described as mania and borderline psychosis. Again I continued begging my girlfriend for help and pushed her even further away, shortly after this she ended things. She made the right decision because I was horrendous and I was dragging her down. This present day I’m on the mend now and I barely remember any of it, the days all merged as one. It feels like someone else has been living/wrecking my life and last week I woke up and have been given it back. I’m now trying to fix all the damage I’ve caused, I’ve lost most of my friends, family and the love of my life. I’ll never give up on her but for now I can only love her from a distance. I hope one day soon she forgives me and wants to speak again but I also need to get some advice if anyone has experienced this before.

"Hi everyone! 

I have a question that has been occupying my mind for a long time, and I hope that this will spark a discussion and we can get deeper into understanding bipolar and find some answers. Maybe some of you are wondering the same.

The question: mostly during manic episodes when my mind is racing at an alarming pace I wonder if this is all caused after all by external factors that make me stressed out OR by the bipolar itself, so from within. Like, I'm starting to stress out because a situation occurs that is out of my control: turmoil in a relationship, some annoying interactions, things at work etc. Or I start stressing out because of a shift towards manic?

 This is where I'm lost: at times I think that because of the diagnosis I overthink the stress and anxious feelings; knowing and convinced about my diagnosis i fully inserted bipolar behavior into my own identity and it informs my actions? But we don't live in a sterile bubble, life is life and always something is happening.


For context: 
during my manic state I start pacing, mind racing, increaced heart rate, twitches and intrusive thoughts. I start walking fast through streets almost running away from this, and I end up looking into passerbys eyes and then it's as if I'm being thrown into their lives, as if I live through their experience, I imagine how they act, what happened in their childhood, flashes into their daily routine, interactions, frustrations and happiness. And then I look at a window on some far away building, start imagining and experiencing the life of another person in a similar way.
 Then I get thrown back into my body into reality and become more overwhelmed. Then it's my own memories of the past, then imagining my own future and so on. 

 
The experience is intense and doesn't stop. When it wears off eventually I regain focus, calm and ability to think clearer. Happens periodically about every few months and lasts usually about a week, maybe 2(depending how I deal with it after the peak. It's not the most intense that happened but I don't wanna go in even more details, because this is already TL;DR 

Edit: I have been diagnosed by 4different doctors on 4 separate occasions, and rejected that idea for about 7 years until it became too unbearable and I was legit worried that this time I'm definitely not making it through. 


So let's discuss the initial question! Would love to hear your thoughts about this chicken or the egg question and gain some insights!",Chicken or the egg? discussion!,2

"I'm 30F. Been diagnosed since I was 14. By SEVERAL doctors. My parents never ""agreed"" (as if there's something to agree on a medical diagnosis) so I was unmedicated for most of my life so far. This gave me a lot of time to figure when a phase was coming, what triggers it, but also a lot of time to do stuff I shouldn't, which hindered me greatly. Because of that, I only started living on my own when I was 24, and that's when I started medication. 

To help with all this I have PCOS (which triggers depression) and long periods (which trigger anemia), so when I get my period I get depressive episodes AND I am physically exhausted and depleted. Which causes me to sleep more, which causes me to go further into depression. 

My bf does his best to understand but it's all a bit beyond his grasp. My parents still don't recognize my situation, so they are of no support for me. I don't have many friends, and only one of them is actually supportive, but she has a rough life and is usually busy with lots of work or something similar. 

So, I'm on my own. I want to straighten up my sleep schedules, but I know I can only do that by decreasing the amount of sleep drastically, which will trigger a maniac episode. It's mostly mixed, not generally full blown mania, but it does get there sometimes and it's like a kinder egg, you only know what you got when you open the box. So it can either go ""let's get the house deep cleaned"" or ""let's blow up our credit card, take on 76 projects I won't complete and f*ck the neighborhood"". You never know.

"Basically what it says in the title.

In theory, I know exercise helps with symptoms, and I like going to the gym when I'm not in the depths of depression. However, when I'm depressed, it's nearly impossible for me to motivate myself to go even semi-consistently. I get stuck doing nothing. I have trouble getting myself to put my gym clothes on, let alone actually walking there and completing a workout.

Also, I don't experience much, if any, of the usual pleasure I get after I work out (normally I'd feel better afterwards) when I'm depressed, so it's pretty hard to convince myself to do it because ""I'll feel better later"".

I've tried going for longer walks and other stuff, but if I'm honest dragging myself around my city in the rain alone with my dark thoughts doesn't help much. I go out most days with my dog, but when it gets bad I can't even begin to face it.

I know I sound like I'm being lazy and dramatic, but I'm serious. I really can't stand the idea of getting up, putting on my clothes, putting on my shoes, getting my dog ready, finding my keys, finding my phone, putting on my coat, locking up, going down the stairs in my apartment building, walking for 40 minutes, climbing the stairs again, then unlocking my door and going in. I get stuck between steps and find myself outside alone in the cold too sad to walk home, or staring at the stairs (pun) in my building unable to drag myself up them.

I get psychomotor slowing when I'm really bad.  It's physically difficult to walk. It feels like my body is made of lead. Sometimes it takes me over an hour to complete an activity that would normally take me half that time.

"Background: I'm bipolar 2. I'm a 42 year old man. In addition to the bipolar, I'm autistic and have been severely abused throughout my life. My wife left me suddenly and with no warning after 15 years of marriage. I'm still in love with her despite her cheating on me twice. I blamed myself, but it doesn't change anything. She also left me with both of our kids, who I love a lot, they're 10 and 15. We've decided to slow date again, and see if we can actually be together, but she's already saying it's hopeless before the first date. Yeah, I know, it's a really bad sign, but I have to try for me.

Now: I can't stop sobbing all the time. Like hard, hurt sobbing. I'm in therapy and I'm on meds. I'm not actively suicidal, but I am starting to worry that I might be slipping into a suicidal trance. I think about it daily and I keep pushing the kids into my brain to stop it. I don't really have anyone to talk to because of the aforementioned marriage, there's a lot there and a LOT of people would tell me don't give her a second chance, including my 15 year old. I feel so fucking stupid for still loving her despite the harm she's caused me. But let's get back on subject. Today, when I was signing out of work on Slack I typed ""Bye"" to my boss unconsciously, I've never done that before, it's always been, ""See you Monday,"" or something else. I held my 3 cats each in turn today and just wept and hugged them. I wandered around the house (I work from home) after work and just felt melancholic and went into each of the rooms and thought about memories in that room. I don't know what my brain is trying to get me ready for, but I'm scared of myself right now. I can't really talk about it out loud to too many people because if the divorce goes forward I might lose custody of the kids because of it, even though they've both said they want to be with me and she is the one who left. So here I am. I don't know what is happening, I'm scared and I have no where to really turn at the moment.",I feel like I'm subtly giving up and I can't stop,2

"24yoF. I was recently diagnosed this past December. Bipolar (and other mental illnesses) runs genetically on my mothers side of the family (i didn’t get to know my mom she died) her sister is bipolar, but she is a very heavy meth addict, so i dont really go to her for advice or support. My dad is one of those people that don’t believe in a mental illness. My doctor has given me a low dose Seroquel/cymbalta combo and it does help 75% of the time. I also started a new job, i used to be a medical assistant, but i honestly think it made my condition so much worse. I think i always showed signs of being bipolar but never recognized them. But when i was a medical assistant i think it made me so much worse. I’m here because is anyone else’s mania miserable? When I’m manic it’s like I’m so overwhelmed with adrenaline. I cant sleep, extreme irritation/rage and horrible anxiety. How have you learned to tell the difference between how you actually truly feel, and when your being irrational?

I don’t really know what went wrong as I took my meds and I have a passive nature in general. No manic outbursts or emotional ones at all.  We all were laughing and having a great time laughing and doing fun activities. But as soon as I got home one of them just didn’t want anything to do with me anymore. And I truly believe it was discriminatory behavior because I would bring up my diagnosis/ make jokes of because they would do the same. (Making jokes of my diagnosis helps me cope in a way) It took me bit to collect myself but I’m doing a whole lot better with therapy now that they’re not in my life anymore. They were also very against seeking medical advice for mental illness and rather get high and not address their issues with a professional. Has anyone else here ever lost close friends that backstabbed you over your diagnosis? Or is it better for people with this disease to just keep everyone at arms length and give the cold shoulder out of fear of discrimination or assumptions on what they think bipolar is?

Amy was recently diagnosed with generalized anxiety after a stressful life event.  Amy knows about my diagnoses and we are very close, so she has turned to me for questions and emotional support.  I love Amy.  I want to support Amy the best I can.  But the amount of emotional support she is asking for is starting to drain my own mental health resources for staying stable.  Additionally, Amy makes a lot of comments about our experiences being the same and she “gets what’s it’s like for me now” when she very clearly does not.  She is not making these comments from a place of ill intentions.  I know mental illness is not a contest and mental health treatment is important for everyone.

The consequences of the episodes have been serious, especially when younger. I haven’t been able to hold a job and am on disability. 

Unlike many of you that I see here I am often not able to ‘catch’ myself, and once it’s at a certain point I lose all insight and am belligerent if people try to suggest I’m not ok. Last year I seemed to have a good year and felt more hopeful and optimistic than for some time. But that came crashing down when I was suddenly arrested and dragged off to hospital in the New Year (I’d done nothing criminal but I guess I must’ve been acting strange). 

One of the hardest things for me is the shame and humiliation for how I acted when manic while being adamant that there was nothing wrong with me. In retrospect I could have been seriously harmed or worse when I used to roam around the streets at night and do risky things.

I sent her receipts that it’s him after me. Eventually he stopped contacting me knowing I’d snitch.

It’s been 8 years and I’m now diagnosed, and medicated myself. I recently had my own daughter. I’ve been thinking about him, and looked him up. He reached out to me 2 years ago, right before I was diagnosed, and I responded with his arrest record.

As I’m looking into him, I find out he was in a coma from going in to cardiac arrest. He’s learning to walk, talk and move his hands again. It looks like he lost a finger. His family hasn’t posted any information about how or why. Also my daughter has the same name as his mom, totally forgot his moms name and my spouse picked the name.

I’m in this fog of wanting to reach out, but also, why? We are living separate lives. It’s been almost a decade! I questioned if it was real love or the mania for so long..

My spouse and father of my daughter is a good guy. He’s stable and loving. He isn’t jealous and we have talked about the ex in the past. We have agreed that we chose each other and not the ex’s. However, he will never understand what not being in full control is like.

It’s how I ended up on this sub. Looking to see if I was as crazy as I felt. Looking for similar experiences and stories, and boy did I find my community.

"Before I get into this, I know I was an asshole and I regret it so much that I’m crying. That’s why I’m here to ask so I don’t have to be judged by people I know. 

I’ve been fine for a while, surprisingly, considering I’ve been off my meds for a while. But yesterday was rough. I was starting to feel depressed and numb again so I did everything I could to keep it at bay. I went out, I tried to do hobbies, spend some time outside. But then my anxiety and paranoia started setting in. I feel like I was being watched and veery sound the woods made freaked me out. Eventually I couldn’t stand it anymore and had to go inside and go to bed. 

Something to note, I’ve been off my meds but just recently realized I was a fucking idiot and am moving back onto them. For context of the next day, I took some hydroxyzine last night to help me calm down and sleep. I tend to wake up a bit groggy but it fades. 

But today i’ve felt horrible. I’ve been depressed, irritable, paranoid, I just don’t want to be here anymore dealing with it. 
I have a dog and because of our house set up, I have to spend all day in the dining room with dining chairs and tile floor. No where to lay down. So I laid on the floor. Earlier I had been throwing a toy for my dog but stopped because my energy felt so low. 

As I was lying there, she kept nipping at my heels and barking when I told her to stop. Finally, my anger boiled over and I yelled at her. I said awful things to her that I don’t want to repeat, even to strangers on the internet. I put her in her crate and went to the bathroom to take a bath and calm down. I feel so awful about it and I hate feeling like this and hurting others. My medicine is supposed to help me but as soon as I started taking it again, this happened.

"hello! i’m writing here because i’m not too sure where else to look.

i have adhd, sensory processing disorder and an on the gifted spectrum. 
recently i’ve been going to therapy for adhd, and a few weeks ago my psych brought up that i might have bipolar. i’ve done a lot of research and have talked a lot about it when her,and i definitely have bipolar.
im going to see a psychiatrist and try to get meds for it, but i wanted to see if anyone else is like this before i get it checked out.

i do not experience intense anger. like… at all.
even before i started questioning if i had bipolar, i knew that i didn’t have the ability to get angry. 
sure, i get irritated- but that’s only at my family members. in public i don’t display or even feel anger. 

maybe it’s because as a girl, any negative or ‘masculine’ emotion is seen as undesirable, but plenty of girls get angry.


i know not all people with bipolar experience aggressive behaviour, but i feel like i should at least be a little angry? i’m irritable at the most, and i feel like it’s the only trait of bipolar i DONT experience.
if anyone else feels a lack of anger, please let me know :)",i don’t get angry. can i still be bipolar?,2

My hair is hip length and a big chunk in the front is not even chin length, it's like a bob with hip length hair at the back, man I loved my hair! Everyone loved my hair and now I feel so embarrassed because everyone is asking me, what happened? I feel so sad, I'm constantly Googling how long does hair take to grow out but it's so uneven, and that bothers me so much!

That's why I cut it in the first place because it was slightly uneven and it triggered my OCD, do people who have both bipolar and OCD, know what I mean? Sometimes, my OCD triggers a manic episode, and it's so hard to ignore these silly and persistent thoughts.

"I recently had to lower my lithium (under doctor supervision) because my lithium level was too high. I started to notice that I felt less numb. I felt butterflies in my stomach and a warm, fuzzy happy for the first time since I was a teenager. It was intoxicating. So I thought to myself, maybe I don’t need my lithium anymore. I never tried stopping it completely after ECT. This was a bad plan…

For the last few days I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time too. The overwhelming depression, self hatred and urge to harm myself. It was terrifying. And I found I was completely out of practice in suppressing those feelings. 

Back on my lithium… I am the first one to advocate taking your pills so I feel like a hypocrite. I have been reminded that deep in my mind bipolar is still there and still capable of destroying me. It was humbling, terrifying and discouraging all at the same time. Today I mourn the fact that I will never be able to fully feel emotions and will always have to be “sedated” to some degree. I shouldn’t complain because at least I have stability. But that taste of what life is really supposed to feel like and knowing I will never have it has left me in a bad way. I feel ungrateful for the stability I have and greedy for the way I used to feel before getting sick. I feel here is the only place where people will understand what I’m going through. - sincerely a very tired bipolar warrior",I got a stern reminder that being stable doesn’t mean I am cured,2
"I was diagnosed 6 years ago with type 2 bi polar disorder and my God what a fucking battle it has been, from being on various medications at first to being on/off with meds to being stable on meds and now eventually being off my meds.

Having this disorder is just too indescribable and majority of the people I've come across don't understand it, especially those close to me which is pretty fucked up. The constant questions of ""what's wrong with you"" to ""why are you like this""
When I try to explain to my family members that I have a disorder they turn around and say ""don't speak that over your life."" Like tf? (They quite religious)

Half the time I have no reason to feel how I feel and I control my impulses, my moods and my outbursts to seem normal to the world but its soooooo draining to feel like one day you on top of the world and life is great and then the next few days you feel like a piece of shit who doesn't deserve anything good. I guess thats just joys of not being on meds but even being on meds I still had to control it, there was better periods of stability but there was moments of is this shit working?

The episodes that come whether depressive or manic unfortunately it seems as if my family doesn't believe it and it's all in my head...excuse the pun there but its really fucked up. Having this disorder has messed with my life in ways I couldn't imagine and in the past I didn't know its coz I'm mentally ill, I just thought this is me being normal until I was diagnosed everything made sense as to why I am the way I am. My habits and my patterns my way of thinking.

I've lost out on so much I've been through so much and the funny part is I have nothing to show for it like it's been a wasted life. People came into my life and left me after they get to know me the rest of my family doesn't get it some of my friends claim they get it but their behavior states otherwise.

I'm always in a place of I don't know and I keep living in my head and it really fucking sucks coz it feels like I can't find myself or my place in this world and all I can sit here and say is I wish I wasn't bi polar.",Being bi polar and no one understands you,2
"  

Dear Journal…well I really don’t know that much about you being dear… that’s clearly a lie as it is the first time I write in this type of journal -though I had been writing quite often on “my phone journal”-. Either way, dear beloved, and most precious electronic journal, I will bless thee with the presence of worded words that word the words I word. Today’s riveting topic…. My day! As I don’t think I have the mental capacity to write about anything else of meaning… or do I? The purpose of this journal thing is to make me a better writer in both English and Spanish, yet if all I put into the white walls is rubbish and nonsense, how am I to become better at throwing electronic ink at immaterial wood-stuff? Perhaps I should find something… as simple as it may be…something I can turn into cohesion. I guess it is as good a time as ever to speak about feelings… my feelings, nonetheless.

How does anxiety feel? I know we’ve all been there. Any E-scripture on anxiety that you might stumble upon will say as much, but, baring mental health professionals, I don’t think that those of us that enunciate the word “anxiety” with statistical-outlier levels of frequency have the same notion of the concept than those whose usage falls into the mean. What I mean by that, of course, is that those of us afflicted by pathological levels of anxiety feel it in a quantitively and qualitatively different way. I guess that’s why we get diagnosed… catalogued as distinct by the authorities that oversee defining this part of society. We’re a messy bunch. It reflects in all facets of my life.

I have messy hair, messy eyes, my room is messy my thoughts are scattered (and messy!), I can’t make a decision for the love of myself; the short version: I don’t work. I mean that both literally and figuratively, whatever that means! (think about it! What does the verb “to work” mean in a literal way? Is it having a job? But that’s having a job, we call it work because you do motions in a job, but we call the motions “work”, because “work” is the act of physical exertion right? I don’t know, this is literal garbage that I’m talking right now (talking/writing “garbage” can’t literally be literal (I think I just transferred a calque from Spanish, too long to get into this tangent))). I can’t hold a normal job; I can’t hold my emotions most of the times. Today some guy at the mall forgot my coffee, and I felt like as if I’ve murdered someone. I mean, I’ve never killed anyone -and I hope I never do such a heinous thing-, but you know that feeling you get in your chin, your chest and neck that pushes you down? The one you get when something bad, really bad is about to happen? I was feeling that over a coffee man. I stared the guy directly in the eye, not with the best of intentions. I was literally offended, but I don’t feel that it was in a normal way. How do I know that? Cause I didn’t use to be like that. Emotions, to me, seem to work now like to a BPD patient (perhaps I have BPD traits?). How do emotions work for BPD patients? Simple! Take an emotion X and then square it. A more detailed example: anger(in BPD afflicted individual) = anger\^2. Or perhaps it’s even a cubical function: i.e., anger\^3 (I don’t even remember if cube is exponential 3). Anxiety is writing parenthesis excusing yourself of mistakes in your personal journal entries that no one else will ever fucking read.

Anxiety is looking at your neighbor and running away inside your home for no reason. Anxiety is feeling gutted for dreaming about the people that made you the happiest you’ve been in ages. Anxiety is snapping at those who love you, because you can’t love yourself and everything has a bitter taste to shit. Anxiety is wanting to die, looking at places where you could hang yourself, feeling relief at the thought of no longer breathing, imagining a knife to the throat, thinking about swerving into traffic, travelling, and not feeling anything, kissing someone you’re deeply into and not feeling anything, doubting everything you do, every single cell in your body being inadequate. Anxiety is knowing at a scientific level that something is wrong, but still suffering through it. Anxiety is abusing drugs, anxiety is depression, anxiety is the antithesis of life, of enjoyment, of love and all that’s good. This is “anxiety”, as this is obviously a corrupted, poisonous version of a feeling that’s supposed to help us survive: i.e., anxiety. “Anxiety” turns a survival tool against those who are trying to survive.

"How do you handle barking security agents, boarding passes, changing itinerary, foreign languages, rude locals, etc. without losing it? Here's what's worked for me:

Photograph \*everything\* important - passports, credit cards, boarding passes, luggage, and store the photos in a locked folder on your phone. This helps recovery of lost items, lower your footprint if you get robbed, and it creates backups because you never know.

Try to research as much ahead of time - Rick Steves advises to book the important stuff, but keep things open ended. I've found, since I'm so easily distracted, to have a few good options at all times that you can do in case things are getting weird. 

Go easy on the coffee - first thing I want to do in an airport or a new city is to have coffee. There's downtime, I'm jetlagged, weary, and already overstimulated, and caffeine I think adds to my disorganization. If I get lost, it makes me look even more like a crackhead asking for directions. It's best to get acclimated then act like a local.

Assume you will get lost and account for it - my sense of directions are terrible.

"It's been a very rough past couple years and so many things have been affected by what's happened. To be clear I am not suicidal in any capacity. My cat would never forgive me and I do enjoy being alive even when it's chaotic and kinda terrible.

I have basically been rapid cycling the past 11 months with a few intermittent bigger episodes, dealing with a very fresh PTSD development due to being in an abusive relationship with someone who in a psychotic rage beat a woman so bad he caved in part of her skull. He's in prison now but it doesn't erase the damage done to her or me.

I had 6 months med access instability, 1.5 years of job instability, housing environment instability, other health problems (ever tried to use your hands when you can't feel 80+ percent of them?) and these god damn hallucinations and crying spells really need to fking stop.

I've been trying out more meds, different med combos, self-care, coping mechanisms. I've been in therapy and physical therapy and those are helping. I keep my appointments with my specialists and p-doc. I do my job the best I can and try to keep my shit together but I've been barely holding my head above water for such a long time with it all and I feel like I'm about to drown.

No, correction. I feel like I'm drowning. I've been drowning for a  while and I just realized it.

I'm just trying to survive and it's getting harder and harder to do so. I'm bawling just typing this out.

I did my taxes today and for the first time in the 13 years of paying taxes I authorized someone else to talk to the irs if necessary.  I wrote down my important login information. I've been talking to my dad and my sister about the gist of everything. I know my sister will take care of my cat if I can't, I've already gone over all of Annie's overall care and needs especially regarding her medical care and environmental needs.

I need a fresh start. There are too many ghosts in this area that haunt me and my dreams. I've had too much loss and trauma to call it home anymore. I want to move up north to the only place I can call home. I want to move into my dad's place and live with one of the few humans I trust.

I brought it up today and he's thinking about it. I will see what his thoughts are about it later.

I can't stand how things are anymore and I need to be better.

In addition to my lithium, lamictal, vyvanse, buspirone, propranolol and gabapentin, I started vraylar last week but it's not working fast enough so I start olanzapine tomorrow. Maybe it will help me. I'm really hoping it will help me because I can't hold it together anymore, not even for my cat.

I hate and despise my brain with the fury of a thousand bonfires. I wish I could be normal. I wish I was blissfully unaware of how any of this feels.

I spent most of my 20's learning how to handle bp and to become and stay stable. But apparently my early 30's are having a laugh at what I managed to achieve.

Edit: my dad said yes. I'll be moving mid-may after a few appointments and finalizing everything.

I'm going to be paying cash for my meds for a little while until I can get on Medicaid, but that's okay. I'm hoping to fill my meds as soon as my insurance lets me (up to 5 days before the days supply ends) so I can build up extra. Maybe try to get a vacation override or something towards the end. I'm gonna work some extra shifts to build up some money. I gotta get Annie to the the vet for her annual exam and refills of her phenobarbital. And ask the vet if she will authorize an early refill or prescribe a larger volume so there's more of a buffer zone for her (because her seizures are both heartbreaking and terrifying at the same time).

I have so much to do! I have more hope again. God damn I love my dad. He's always been beyond awesome and supportive, he has been one of my biggest supporters in multiple ways over the years. I legitimately don't know if I would be here typing this if he wasn't who he is.

I had some happy tears today and I'm like to think they outweighed all the sad and angry ones that I've had lately.

A miscarriage I still mourn and how I never told him that I named her. The depth of complexity and severity of my nerve, skin and gut problems and how much money has been spent on them.

i’m diagnosed bipolar type 1, i’ve only had one manic episode that led to psychosis. mostly, i struggle with rapid cycles of mixed mania, hypomania and depression when unmedicated.
the last maybe month or so(?) i guess i’ve had a decreased need for sleep. so much that my psychiatrist noticed it before i did and prescribed medicine for sleep. i’m taking my mood stabilizers regularly but for some reason i just cannot make myself take sleeping medication and these past two weeks i’ve noticed have been pretty worrisome while reflecting on it(change in sex drive and drugs, unlike myself and putting myself in dangerous situations) i’m just really afraid of bringing it up to anybody for fear of judgement. i know how silly it is to have the solution to my problem right in front of me, and i don’t want to make it seem like i don’t care about my mental health.
i am experiencing all symptoms of (hypo?)mania and some mixed features of depression. it was really nice for a few days of this week but just like my first manic episode, the only way i can describe it is like, you’re going so high up on a roller coaster that when you feel it slipping down, it’s scary and drastic and you do everything you can to keep going up just so it doesn’t crash. i feel like im in the beginning stages of that and i really don’t want to do this. the euphoria and attractiveness of mania is incredible, but the constant racing thoughts and heart rate, the irritability and anxiety are uncomfortable and i know im prone to psychosis.
it seems like the easiest solution would be to actually take my prescribed medication, but it is really hard for me. i feel like there’s so much more time i have to get stuff done later in the night and i see it as a waste to go to bed so early especially when i don’t need to. i’m aware of how ridiculous it all sounds but i don’t know what to do to make myself take the medication. i know i have to but i genuinely just do not want to, but unfortunately i know this is probably contributing to mania.

"First, thank you for reading my rant, even if you don't make it to the end...

Life advice please...

30f, relationship with 31m, anf we have a 9mo son.

We lost the home we were renting back in Dec, due to mold. We've been back and forth between the in-laws since. I'm in school and he is looking for work, but also is waiting for his Bar exam results.

I can't stand living with other people. I'm currently dealing with my mental health (Bipolar and ADHD) and it's hard to function at times. The other day I was overwhelmed by my MIL who wanted us to bring the baby over to meet some family last minute. That ended with me yelling at her when she came to the car wanting to take my son out because he was crying. I told her to worry about her children, not mine.

This morning at 6am, I woke up to find my partner in his parents room talking. When he came back he stated ""It's me &amp; you"" over and over. Later, he explained how no one will understand me or my Bipolar and how much weight I carry and how hard it can get for me on a daily basis. He didn't go into full details of the convo because I'm an overthinker, but him stating his parents asking if I'm in therapy or taking medications, made it obvious. That's when my partner got upset because he saw how I consistently have to deal with our families not understanding. As I told him, not many ever will.

I hate living with the in-laws. I love them, but I don't do well with the MIL always home. Having someone consistently there and always watching what's being done with my son, being there to greet him all the time, or making opinions like ""he's hungry, he wants milk, look at this, look at that"" etc has really been getting on my nerves. To the point that now I can't stand her voice or go into a negative mood when I know she's going to be around.

My partner and I both feel uncomfortable staying at each others parents. Financially we are unstable at the moment and were trying to figure out what our next move is...

When my son was born, the first two weeks, we got covid. Then, after 6 months of living alone, we lose our home to mold. During Christmas, I went through a perfect storm of depression with losing the house and overwhelmed by everyone wanting to meet my son. I feel like his first year was one of the hardrst for me and I want to be able to enjoy these 3 months before he turns a year, but it's been so hard...

SO!

Any advice? Any recommendations on work from home? Any knowledge regarding starting a dropshipping business to earn an income?

"So... I usually don't post anything on Reddit, but here we go.

About eight months ago, I was diagnosed with BP2. I've struggled with mental health issues all my life (anxiety, depression) and developed PTSD at a pretty young age. After a few years of fluctuating emotions I went to see a psychologist, and I got my diagnosis. I was also diagnosed with asperger's syndrome back in 2019.

I've been on a mood stabilizer (lamictal) since I was diagnosed, and it's made things easier for me, but exam season (last year of high school) is coming up and I lowkey feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm experiencing mixed moods every other week, I can't really sleep anymore, and every day I'm torn between ignoring everyone around me, freaking out, or acting friendly, because I know I shouldn't take my own mental illness out on anyone. I'm either tired, stressed, occasionally productive, or filled with a kind of self-loathing and sadness that I can't even begin to describe. I'm worried I'll be thrown straight into a depressive episode soon, because stress is my biggest trigger. Very few people (two of my friends and my immediate family) know that I'm bipolar, and I don't even want to tell **them** about how I feel right now. I think a lot of people on here can relate to that crushing feeling that you're a burden to your loved ones, even when they tell you you're not. I considered the possibility that things might get better if I told someone, but I just don't have the energy, and I don't want to let people in because I'm ashamed that I'm losing control. Explaining how I feel to someone is difficult (asperger's, yay) and there aren't many people I trust with my emotions. The people I trust are the ones I don't want to burden.

I wanted to ask, does it get any easier? Not to board the self-pity train or anything, but I'm not even 20, and thinking about the future terrifies me. I don't want to fall apart and fake that I'm okay every time a problem arises. I don't want to isolate myself because I'm scared of affecting people. I don't want to experience all these episodes over and over again. I just... don't know what to do right now.

Also, if anyone has any advice on how to keep going and staying productive, I'd really appreciate it. &lt;3",Are things going to get any better?,2

Does anyone else experience these in spurts? I’ve seen research that says it could be a manic episode coming on. I haven’t remembered my dreams in a while but i’ve had a bad one every night the past four days. They always happen right before I wake up.,So many nightmares.,2
"I know I've had at least one episode of what was probably psychosis because I was diagnosed with stress induced psychosis when it was happening. I don't know if that one was bipolar related or not, and I wasn't treated with anything at the time because I was still quite young and the psychiatrist didn't want to intervene with medication.

However, I've had other symptoms since during what were probably undiagnosed manic or mixed episodes where I've started to believe things that were, retrospectively, pretty weird. Occasionally these beliefs also pop up when I'm very, very depressed. Sometimes I believe these things 100% unquestioningly, and other times I know they don't make sense but worry about them excessively anyway. Sometimes it fluctuates between the two.

A common one for me is worrying that other people can hear my thoughts, especially if I look at them directly. I also get concerns about people working against me or talking about me behind my back to try to ruin my life.

Another time I became convinced my childhood home was haunted and that a demon had followed me from there into my daily life. I kept seeing a figure in my room at night and I worried about speaking about him out loud in case he came for me. I still worry about this sometimes, and tbf I'm pretty sure that house really was haunted. My childhood friends and I talk about the weird slightly paranormal stuff that happened there so I'm not alone with that, but my sudden obsession with it was abnormal.

I told a different psychiatrist about those two a while back and he said it was probably due to a combination of autism and trauma, and that it would likely go away with more EMDR. Since they kind of just left as my mood changed, he was satisfied that his therapy had worked.

I had another one where I decided I was actually naturally nocturnal and that other people were interfering with that to purposefully make me sick and stop my plans. I completely flipped my sleep schedule for several weeks (although admittedly I wasn't sleeping very much anyway), and then fought with all my family and friends about it.

At one point I also became very worried that other dog walkers were all talking about me on Facebook and were plotting to take my dog away. 

Another time I was certain I was dying of some horrible illness and all the medical professionals I saw weren't treating me on purpose because they wanted me to die. (I really was sick though, but the level of paranoia was weird).

I was still somewhat functional while all of these were happening, and I wasn't hearing voices or anything for the most part. So does it really count as anything serious? Because it didn't seem that bad to me, and my family just kind of ignored it since they'd been told that the episodes were stress related and it was best not to engage. I've never told a psychiatrist about all of the thoughts because I didn't view them as relevant; until recently, I just thought they were a part of life and it was something I did when I got stressed.

TLDR; at what point does it cross the line into actual psychosis vs ""being paranoid and having weird thoughts""?

I'm going to be starting medication for the first time soon if all goes well. My current psychiatrist is talking about putting me on antipsychotics, but idk if these episodes are really bad enough to warrant taking an antipsychotic. I've been reading about the drugs and they sound like heavy duty stuff, and I can't tell if, for me, it's really necessary. I think I'd rather try another type of mood stabilising medication first.

"Hey everyone, to start I’m a 21 year old female living in the United States. I come from a family that has a close history of Bipolar and ADHD. My grandfather has pretty severe bipolar and due to his refusal to fake traditional medication he’s an addict and has been separated from my family since I was a child. 

I’ve shown signs of being bi-polar for a very long time now, was diagnosed with ADHD, got on the meds for that, but still struggled significantly. I knew everything I was experiencing pointed to Bipolar II, but with it being so taboo in my family after my grandpas actions I refused to ever admit it. 
However now after talking with my psychiatrist he strongly believes I am bipolar and we will start a more in depth diagnosis beginning soon. 

I have mixed feelings, I’ve known that this was most likely the answer but I didn’t want it to be true. I hate that I have to be the one in my family to carry the “bipolar” role, I know they will look down on me and assume I’ll end up the same way that my grandpa did.","Just started the process of getting diagnosed, I’ve spent years in denial despite obvious signs",2

a few months ago, i had my first manic (hypomanic?) episode. It lasted 1-2 months. 

well, after all of the weird behavior, i was urged to see a psychiatrist. and then I was diagnosed.

Ever since being diagnosed and given medication (my first time ever taking daily meds…), i feel somewhat at unease. Even though i have a weird feeling, right now i feel pretty stable and happy. i honestly didnt know medicine could change my life so much. 

But i feel like after experiencing my first manic episode, something in me has changed. Even when im feeling stable, theres some underlying feeling my mood may swing at any given moment. I am still working on finding the best meds for me, so maybe that may have something to do with it?

as a result of this, I learned a lot about medication. not even really on purpose, learning about the meds people are on is just an inevitable of being in a group like this.

"tl;dr should I read Choice Theory or should I change therapists?

So, my therapist has suggested that I read Choice Theory by William Glasser... I used a credit on audible to get it, it is a little over 12 hours long... I haven't started it yet, but what I have read about choice theory tells me I will disagree with a main premise, which my therapist and I kinda got into today...

He insists that thoughts and emotions are choices. Going so far as to say that mental illness is a choice. In regards to bipolar, if you are not having negative consequences, do you have bipolar? Because you can choose your actions and reactions and emotions and thoughts.

That medicine is a crutch and is not necessary.

He says that this gives you the power to control your life and swings and even get rid of swings.

This came up when I was asking about tools because my regular tool for dealing with intrusive thoughts isn't really cutting it for me right now (having the thought, then saying to myself, is this thought beneficial/useful/helpful to me?)

There are several things here that I am in complete disagreement with. Medicine is necessary, thoughts and emotions are not controllable (i.e. they just happen, but can potentially be directed) and, mental illness is real and not a choice.

Sure you can do things to help mitigate symptoms and try and improve yourself, but ~~I am pretty sure~~ I will always have bipolar. He has planted a seed of doubt.

"Hi friends! Sorry if this is the wrong place to post.

I (20F) was diagnosed with BD2 back around October, so still fairly recent. I am super lucky to have a family that encourages me to keep going to therapy and stay on medication, however I’m finding  they don’t really *understand* what I’m going through.

While I’m aware there’s no real way for them to conceptualize what is actually happening to me during hypo episodes more specifically (was misdiagnosed w depression at 17, depression I feel is a little easier understood) I’d like to be able to have them be aware of what an episode is like. I can’t exactly put it all into words when trying to explain it to them myself, and I often feel like doing that ends up scaring/worrying them more. So I’m looking for a resource that can detail what hypomania is really like, whether that be a day-to-day kind of thing, or just an extensive list of symptoms. 

Most recently I spent several days awake, and have had obvious weight loss, which led my dad to ask my older brother if he thought I had been getting into meth/coke, as my dad was previously addicted to meth and experienced similar symptoms.

"The most recent manic episode I had was after being depressed and diagnosed with major depressive disorder to be prescribed Zoloft. Within 6 weeks I was staying up for 9 days and delusional. I thought my partner was going to kill me so I called 911. The police arrived and I was very agitated and explained my delusions and they took me to the nearest psych ward for an evaluation. Unfortunately, that psych ward didn’t keep me long enough despite my volunteering to stay longer. They also gave me a medication I ended up allergic to which took treatment even longer.

This resulted in asking my in-laws who live in a different state miles away to help me care for my daughter until I found the right medication combination and was stable. I knew it could take a few months and I had no one else available local to me. The only way my inlaws would take my daughter is if I signed over guardianship. I was under the impression it would only be for a year at the most. But honestly, I wasn’t really in the right mind to consent to that paperwork. I just knew I needed help and I did what I could to ensure my daughter had the best care possible while I got stable. 

Fast forward to now my partner and I petitioned the courts to end guardianship as I have been stable for 2 years. I have letters from my therapist and pdoc stating I am in treatment and stable and medication compliant. 

Well, my in-laws are trying to prove I am unfit for things I did while I was manic so they can adopt my daughter without my consent or permission through the courts. They're also trying to prove that my partner (their child) is unfit I am less worried about that. 

My therapist says they're on a witch hunt and that they're just trying to raddle me and no judge would grant them adoption. I hope she's right.

"TLDR : I'm bipolar type two with mixed features currently in a hypomanic (mixed?) episode.
I experience some of these things:
- clenched jaw
- 10-15 minute panic attack that disappears in a few seconds leaving you confused but not feeling  bad (just very confused)
- nightmares and night sweating
- completely forgetting to eat and losing the instinct of eating or liking food except shit like sweets cola coffee and chips (with cigs ofc)
Do you?

Note : I'm like 95% sure I'm hypomanic right now and have been for almost a month but was in denial until a week ago, seeing psychiatrist on Friday to talk. 

Anyway, I'm experiencing these things and was wondering if anyone else had this: 
- clenched jaw most of the time
- random 10-15 minute panic attack/dark dissociation (few times a week, had one where i couldn't contain a scream that was just so guttural like I was giving birth and then started hyperventilating so hard I almost fainted and had to sit down and hold onto something to not fall), but then all of a sudden you have a posotive thought and it disappearears in a second making you wonder what even happened and laughing at how dramatic you are
- nightmares or night sweating
- completely FORGETTING TO EAT, like losing the instinct to eat, even when I'm hungry I don't think about food but I think of resolving the problem so I stuff myself with the easiest fastest food that's kinda nutritious and idc about the taste, like plain slices of protein bread, Bananas (I don't even like the texture or the taste of bananas but its the cleanest and most efficient for hunger), vegan pre-made protein shakes in bottles (over 2 months I've consumed about ~100 of them, I have one every morning and other shit ""meal"" mentioned above) and SOMETIMES have the patience to boil a pack of ravioli that takes 3 minutes to cook and eat it just with olive oil and balsamic vinegar or airfry in 10 minutes a pack of vegan nuggets or fish sticks and eat them plain, yup, no sauce and not evem fried, such a treat (less dishes). 

Btw I'm also diagnosed with mixed episodes and I've experienced them, but usually they are way darker and cold with a bit of psychotic moments, and I just feel superior to others like an evil God and I'm full of rage.
Whereas here I feel quite at peace but a bit out of control, but I know that I'm gonna take care of it soon (going back tomorrow to my parents). And overall I feel happy everyday and grateful and I feel like the world is so beautiful but I just have those breakdowns described above few times a week if not almost daily these days...

"I was diagnosed with Bipolar last May after trying to kill myself and did seven nights in a pysc ward which did me so much good.

For awhile before my diagnosis I had talked to my doc about ADHD cause I felt I fitted the symptoms of that so was in shock when I was eventually diagnosed with Bipolar.  When on what I call highs I get extremely productive.  I get so much done and take up new hobbies that never last more than a couple of months.  My lows are never so bad I'm depressed, but I have no energy mentally or physically and no interest in doing anything and I fall behind on everything.  The house gets messy and I struggle to achieve anything.

I have 3 kids so my anxiety goes through the roof when things get messy.  I'm snappy to be around for my wife and my mother and I get into moods because everything in the house is messy again.  It's like a vicious circle.  My lows causes me to let the place get untidy and the mess causes me to spiral into worse moods.

But sometimes when I read what other people go through and mine doesn't seem so bad in comparison I start to doubt I even have Bipolar.  These thoughts sneak into my head, I feel like an imposter and that I'm not really as bad as I think, and I'm only lazy, subconsciously tricking people and cheating by being on illness benefit.

"For context I have type one and a history of 4 hospitalisations in 7 years. ECT (worked amazingly but only for a while), tried loads of medications and it seems like we've finally found a combo that works. I haven't had a serious episode for over two years now. 

I have a two year old son and, despite the manic episode I had after four days is labour when he was born, he's the best thing that has ever happened to my mental health. I love him to bits even though he was a surprise and I was totally sure I wasn't ready.

Now my husband and I want a sibling for him. We both never had siblings of our own, so he has no cousins and we both wish we had siblings. We want a baby sooner rather than later because the age gap keeps getting bigger. 3 years difference is ok, but 4 seems like much more to me. I don't know. I've started taking folic acid and we should be ready to start trying to conceive in May. 

We also happen to be moving across the UK for my husband's work in July. If all goes well, I could be pregnant by then.

I told my psychiatrist this and he told me that my antidepressant, clomipramine, is dangerous to the baby in pregnancy and can cause serious heart defects. He wants to switch me to an SSRI (citalopram), which I've tried several of and they haven't done much for me in the past. Clomipramine worked for me I think because it's also effective in OCD and while I don't have OCD, my depressive thoughts are definitely obsessive. I've been taking clomipramine for since a mild depressive episode I had a year ago and since I haven't had any depression at all and I haven't gone manic either.

I'm just worried with the move (even though I'm really looking forward to it) and the pregnancy and the medication change might be too much. As a mother, I feel having a serious episode is not an option, but then am I just putting more pressure on myself? Is this crazy? Should I try it or wait another year with the baby? Even just changing medication worries me, but I can't consider pregnancy without doing that first.
